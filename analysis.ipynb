Americans saw a number of viral moments during Thursday's House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing focused on security concerns surrounding the use of TikTok in the U.S.     During the hearing, lawmakers questioned TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew over allegations the platform may be being used by China to spy on Americans, its ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and the inappropriate content contained within it.In one viral moment, Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., played a video posted by one TikTok user who threatened to shoot up the hearing, specifically naming members of the committee, that has remained viewable for 41 days.  TIKTOK CEO TELLS ‘ALMOST HALF’ OF US ON CHINESE APP POLITICIANS ‘COULD TAKE TIKTOK AWAY FROM ALL 150M OF YOU’  In the video, a cartoon of a handgun can be seen firing bullets with the caption, \"Me asf at the House Energy and Commerce Committee on 3/23/2023.\"  Cammack noted the video was in violation of TikTok's safety guidelines, and questioned how Chew and the leadership of the platform were capable of protecting Americans' data if they were incapable of policing such content.  The logo of ByteDance app TikTok. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)In another instance, Rep. Neal Dunn, R-Fla., asked Chew if ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, had \"spied on American citizens,\" but the CEO didn't give a direct answer.  \"I don't think that spying is the right way to describe it,\" he responded. TIKTOK DEPLOYS SWARM OF INFLUENCERS TO US CAPITOL AHEAD OF EXPECTED CEO GRILLING  At a separate point in the hearing, Rep. Bob Latta, R-Ohio, pressed Chew over whether employees at ByteDance had access to Americans' user data. He avoided directly answering the question, telling Latta it was a \"complex topic.\"    \"Yes or no? It's not that complex. Yes or no? Do they have access to U.S. data?\" Latta said. Chew then appeared to admit China did have access to such data up until a certain point.BLINKEN SUGGESTS TIKTOK ‘SHOULD BE ENDED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER’On another occasion, Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., pressed Chew on whether he agreed that the Chinese government had persecuted the country's Uyghur minority population in the country's western region of Xinjiang.     Chew responded by saying that all human rights abuses were \"deeply concerning\" to hear about, before Lesko interrupted him and asked him again specifically about the Uyghurs. Chew, again, didn't answer the question, and ultimately avoided answering a total of four times.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP   Brandon Gillespie is an associate editor at Fox News.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he believes in the idea of healthy competition and making sure \"the playing field is level for all,\" in a prepared statement he plans to give before federal lawmakers on Wednesday.    \"Our story would not have been possible without U.S. laws that encourage competition and innovation,\" he said in a statement obtained by Fox News from someone close to the hearing process. \"I believe that strong and consistent competition policy is vital because it ensures that the playing field is level for all. At Facebook, we compete hard, because we’re up against other smart and innovative companies that are determined to win.\"A House antitrust subcommittee was set to grill Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai and Zuckerberg on Monday, but the hearing was delayed due to a memorial service for the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.  Zuckerberg admitted that the size of the tech industry should create cause for concern and said companies such as his should not be singlehandedly making major decisions about national policy.  \"I understand that people have concerns about the size and perceived power that tech companies have,\" he continued. \"Ultimately, I believe companies shouldn’t be making so many judgments about important issues like harmful content, privacy and election integrity on their own. That’s why I’ve called for a more active role for governments and regulators and updated rules for the Internet. If we do this right, we can preserve what’s best about this technology — the freedom for people to connect and express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things — while also protecting society from broader harms.\"  COLORADO REP. KEN BUCK SAYS BIG TECH CEO HEARING WILL COVER PRIVACY, ANTITRUST AND BIAS ALLEGATIONS VideoThe tech industry leader then discusses censorship and the removal of certain content from online platforms, if they qualify as \"harmful.\"  \"We’ve built sophisticated systems to find and remove harmful content,\" he explained. \"We’re funding new technologies to tackle emerging threats like deep fakes. And we’re building products to connect people to authoritative information, like our recently introduced COVID-19 and voter information centers.\"Zuckerberg championed Facebook for connecting citizens to coronavirus statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), while also purging any data or stories considered to be \"misinformation,\" with regard to COVID-19.  He also announced a new Facebook coronavirus \"symptom survey,\" which would take personal health data that is shared by users and combine it with location information, to discover \"where it's appropriate to roll back social distancing orders.\"    \"We connect people to authoritative health information and we’re taking aggressive steps to stop COVID-19-related misinformation and harmful content from spreading,\" he wrote. \"In January, we started displaying educational pop-ups in Facebook and Instagram connecting people to authoritative COVID-19-related information from organizations including the CDC, regional health authorities, and the WHO.\"We’re also using data in new ways to inform the public health response,\" Zuckerberg continued. \"We partnered with Carnegie Mellon University to launch a COVID-19 Symptom Survey that can help researchers predict the spread of the disease. With millions of responses, researchers are able to get a much more detailed picture of the pandemic. We also contributed aggregated anonymized location data to the COVID-19 Mobility Data Network, a group of 40 health researchers whose work helps governments determine if and where it’s appropriate to roll back social distancing orders.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    Facebook has a responsibility to stop people from interfering with online COVID conversations and is tasked with helping to eliminate voter suppression and hate speech, he claimed.\"I understand the concerns people have in these areas, and we are working to address them,\" he said. \"While we are making progress – for example, we have dramatically improved our ability to proactively find and remove harmful content and prevent election interference – I recognize that we have more to do.\"Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., told Fox News about the agenda for the hearing and said, \"There are three issues we are going to be looking at in this hearing. One is the anticompetitive behavior of these platforms. The second is the privacy issue and the third is the bias that some of these platforms engage in.\"                                          \n",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Fun fact: When you set up your iPhone, invisible dots create a detailed map of your face so you can open your phone by looking at it. How many dots are used to map a face? Quiz your friends and family over the holidays. The answer is 30,000. Whoa.    I’m giving away an iPhone. Yep, you can win a new iPhone 15 (valued at $799). To enter, try one issue of my free daily tech newsletter. That’s it. It’s easy to cancel my free newsletter if it’s not for you, but I bet it will be.DON’T WANT TO DROP $1K ON A NEW PHONE? DO THIS INSTEAD  There’s so much built into our smartphones. I’ve been on Team iPhone since the first model, and I’m still discovering new things. No matter your model, I bet there are hidden features you’ll be happy to know.  Find a little peace: White noise is great for getting things done, falling asleep or drowning out more annoying sounds. You don’t need an extra app. Open Settings and tap Accessibility > Audio/Visual > Background Sounds. On the next screen, enable \"Background Sounds\" and tap Sound. Choose between Ocean, Rain, Stream and more.   An Apple iPhone 15 Pro is seen in this illustration photo taken at the store in Krakow, Poland on Oct. 31, 2023. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)  No more clutter: You can take photos through the Notes app on your iPhone so they don’t appear in your camera roll. Go to Settings > Notes, then turn off \"Save to Photos.\" Now, open the Notes app. Create a new note and tap the camera icon > Take Photo or Video.Quick privacy checkup: The App Privacy Report shows how apps use your data. Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > App Privacy Report to access. You can revoke any permissions here if you see something you don’t like.  YOUR PHONE HAS AN EXPIRATION DATE. HERE’S HOW TO FIND IT.G’day mate: You can change your smart assistant’s voice if its dulcet tones get on your nerves. I like the Australian woman’s voice. On iPhone: Go to Settings > Siri & Search > Siri Voice. For Android: On most phones that use Google Assistant, say, \"Hey Google, open Assistant settings.\" Go to All settings > Assistant voice and choose one.  For teeny-tiny print: Open Settings > Accessibility > Touch, then activate the Magnifier. Triple-click the side button, and voila! Your camera becomes a magnifying glass. I used this to see my router’s model number.    Two thumbs-up: Typing with thumbs at the bottom of a screen is so much easier that Amazon redid its shopping app to move the search bar there. Chrome for iPhone is doing the same. Hold down a URL, and you’ll see Move Address Bar to Bottom/Top. Cool, right?   Customers experience iPhone 15 series phones at an Apple store in Shanghai, China, Sept. 24, 2023. (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Update bug: The upgrade to iOS 17 reset some users’ privacy settings. If you've ever deactivated Significant Locations on your iPhone, the update may have turned it back on. Review the steps now to make sure it's off if you prefer it that way.If you don’t text back: Like with email, you can mark a text as unread, making it easier to remember to respond. On iPhone, simply swipe right on a conversation to mark it as unread.     Powering down: This one is for the iPhone 15 only. Open Settings > Battery, you can see when to replace your battery. You have to get deep into your phone's analytics to do that on an older model. Privacy, please: Nearly every social media site strips out the metadata that reveals a photo's little details, like when, where and how it was taken, but not the data showing when you text a pic. You can stop that. Open the image you want to send and tap the share button. Select Options and toggle off Location. Tap Done.EVERYDAY TECH HACKS: FROM PHONE SHORTCUTS TO WEBCAM MAGIC  The best emergency setting in years: Emergency SOS allows you to contact help if you’re stuck somewhere without cell service. It’s already saved lives. You can use Emergency SOS by pressing the side button and one of the volume buttons until the Emergency SOS slider pops up. Drag the slider or continue holding the side and volume buttons to contact emergency services automatically. Before you ever need it, set up your Medical ID and emergency contacts.    Siri, stop: You can change your smart assistant settings to summon Siri when your phone is unlocked — or turn it off altogether. Open the Settings > Siri & Search. Tap Listen for and select Off. You can turn off Allow Siri When Locked to prevent Siri from activating if a button’s pressed in your pocket.Now that you’re iPhone smart … enter to win an upgrade!

We all know that Google is a powerful search engine. It also tracks our online activities, locations and interests. The tech giant collects and stores a lot of data about us, which can be useful for some purposes yet also risky for others.    CLICK HERE TO GET MY FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTER WITH SECURITY ALERTS AND THE LATEST BLACK FRIDAY DEALS  Google collects and stores a lot of data about us, which can be useful for some purposes yet also risky for others. (Kurt Knutsson, CyberGuy)The double-edged sword of Google’s data in criminal investigationsOne of the purposes that Google’s data can serve is to help law enforcement solve crimes. Sometimes, when the police have few clues or leads, they can turn to Google for information on who searched for a certain term or who was near a crime scene at a certain time.  This also means that Google’s data can inadvertently implicate innocent people who happen to search for something or be somewhere that is related to a crime. They can become suspects or witnesses in investigations that they have nothing to do with.  Google’s data can help law enforcement solve crimes. (Kurt Knutsson, CyberGuy)How Google’s data is used in police investigations  There are two main ways that Google’s data is used in police investigations: search-term warrants and location warrants.  Google’s data is used in police investigations in two ways: search-term warrants and location warrants. (Kurt Knutsson, CyberGuy)  HOW TO DIG UP DIRT ABOUT YOURSELF ONLINESearch-term warrantsA search-term warrant is a court order that requires Google to provide information on anyone who searches for a specific term or phrase on its platform. Google does not provide the names or personal information of the users who searched for the terms, but rather anonymized identifiers that can be linked to specific devices. However, this does not mean that the users are completely anonymous, as the police can use other methods to track them down, such as IP addresses, geolocation or subpoenas.  For example, in 2020, Denver police obtained a search-term warrant for anyone who looked up the address of a house where a suspected arson killed five people. They used this information to identify and charge suspects with murder. However, those suspects were not convicted. Their lawyers argued that the warrants violated their constitutional rights.Search-term warrants are relatively rare, and their legality is still being debated in courts. Some judges have approved them, while others have rejected them as unconstitutional.  The main argument against them is that they violate the First Amendment right to free speech and the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  The main argument against search-term warrants is that they violate the First and the Fourth Amendments. (Kurt Knutsson, CyberGuy)    DON'T FALL FOR THIS LATEST ANTIVIRUS PROTECTION SCAMLocation warrantsA location warrant is a court order that requires Google to provide information on anyone who was near a certain location at a certain time based on the location data that Google collects from its users’ devices. These warrants can turn anyone into a suspect just by virtue of their GPS coordinates.For example, in Florida, police obtained a location warrant for anyone who was near the site of a home burglary and used this information to investigate a man who rode his bicycle nearby. The debate here centers on the balance between collective security and individual privacy.    Location warrants are more common than search-term warrants, and they have been used in various cases, including the 2021 Capitol riot. However, they also face legal challenges and criticism from civil liberties advocates.The main argument against them is that they are too broad and indiscriminate and that they sweep up innocent people who have no connection to the crime.  The use of large-scale warrants for Google data has both advantages and disadvantages for law enforcement and the public. (Kurt Knutsson, CyberGuy)HOW TO REIN IN YOUR ONLINE EXPOSURE  AND REMOVE YOURSELF FROM GOOGLE SEARCHESThe pros and cons of large-scale warrants for Google data  The use of large-scale warrants for Google data has both advantages and disadvantages for law enforcement and the public.    On one hand, these warrants can help solve crimes that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to crack. They can provide valuable leads and evidence that can link suspects to crimes or clear them from suspicion. They can also help identify victims or witnesses who may need protection or assistance.On the other hand, innocent people can get caught up in investigations that they have nothing to do with. Their privacy can be invaded, their personal information exposed, and intimidated and harassed.How Google balances user privacy and law enforcement requests  According to Google’s privacy policy, they have procedures to protect the privacy of their users while supporting the important work of law enforcement. They state that they carefully review each request for user information and try to limit the scope or object to it if it is too broad or does not follow the correct process. They also say that they notify users of requests for their information unless they are legally prohibited, or there is an imminent threat to life or serious physical injury.However, they also reserve the right to share user information with law enforcement in certain circumstances, such as when they have a valid legal process, a court order, a search warrant or an emergency disclosure request.  We reached out to Google for a comment on this story and had not heard back as of our deadline.   According to Google’s privacy policy, they have procedures to protect the privacy of their users while supporting the important work of law enforcement. (Kurt Knutsson, CyberGuy)  ASK KURT: HOW TO NAVIGATE GOOGLE'S PRIVACY SETTINGSWhat you can do to protect your privacy and rightsIf you are concerned about how Google’s data can be used in police investigations, there are some steps you can take to protect your privacy and rights.  One step is to limit the amount of data that Google collects and stores about you. You can do this by adjusting your privacy settings on your Google account, using private browsers, turning off your location services or using VPNs, deleting your search history or using incognito mode, and opting out of personalized ads, or using ad blockers. Even then, there is no guarantee your location and personal information isn’t being recorded.     Another step is to know your rights if you are contacted by law enforcement officials who want to access your Google data. You can do this by consulting a lawyer before you respond to any requests or demands.Ask for a copy of the warrant or court order that authorizes the access. You can challenge the validity or scope of the warrant or court order if it is too broad or vague. Seek legal representation if you are accused of a crime or sued for damages.Google’s data can be a powerful tool for solving crimes, but it can also be a potential threat to your privacy and rights. By being aware of how it is used in police investigations and by taking steps to protect yourself, you can enjoy the benefits of Google’s services without risking the drawbacks.  11 THINGS TO ADD TO YOUR PRIVACY CHECKLIST ONLINE ASAPKurt’s key takeaways  Google’s data can be both a blessing and a curse in a police investigation. It can help solve crimes, but it can also get you in trouble. That’s why it’s important to be careful about what you search and where you go online and to know your rights if the police come knocking.How do you feel about Google’s data collection and use in criminal investigations?

Kurt \"The CyberGuy\" Knutsson explains how you can share the audio message on iPhone and Android.  In an alarming revelation, Bitdefender Labs has uncovered a sinister turn in cybercrime tactics on Facebook. Hackers are using a new virus called NodeStealer to steal your cookies and passwords. It’s a sneaky piece of code that runs on JavaScript and Node.js, and it can grab your web browser data and use it to hack into your Facebook account.How NodeStealer works    How do they do it?

When you click on these ads, you’re actually downloading the NodeStealer virus, which then starts to spy on your online activity.CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH SECURITY ALERTS, QUICK VIDEO TIPS, TECH REVIEWS, AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER  NodeStealer is a virus that seeks to steal information, like passwords, from Facebook users.

But don’t fall for it. These ads are actually hiding a nasty virus that can steal your passwords and personal information.  Bitdefender researchers found that at least 10 Facebook accounts that belong to businesses have been hacked and used to spread these ads. The ads have a link that says, \"Photo Album,\" but when you click on it, you download a file that infects your computer. The file then gets access to your browser cookies and passwords, which lets the hackers get into your accounts.MORE: DON'T FALL FOR THAT \"LOOK WHO DIED\" FACEBOOK MESSAGE TRAP   Hackers post ads with women on Facebook in an attempt to lure people into clicking on them, thereby stealing their information.

Having good antivirus software actively running on your devices will alert you of any malware in your system, warn you against clicking on any malicious links in phishing emails, and ultimately protect you from being hacked. Review of the 2023 Best Antivirus Protection here.  Practice good cyber hygiene: Exercise caution in your digital interactions. Refrain from clicking on unsolicited links, particularly those associated with alarming notifications or ads urging you to download enticing media files.    Beware of suspicious ads: Specifically, for this NodeStealer campaign, you should be wary of any ad prompting the download of photo albums, especially if the source is Bitbucket, Gitlab, or Dropbox. Such ads are likely traps set by cybercriminals to deploy NodeStealer malware onto your device.Scrutinize unusual account activity: Keep an eye out for any unusual activity on your accounts. Unexpected password-reset emails, unrecognized logins, or uninitiated security changes can be red flags signaling a compromised account.Educate and inform: Share your knowledge about these threats with friends and family. The more informed people are, the less likely they are to fall victim to these schemes. Sign up for my security alerts by subscribing to my CyberGuy Newsletter here.

What we found is a nation still deeply tied to the social network, but increasingly skeptical of its data privacy promises.  Still engaged A vast majority of the respondents said they still use Facebook or have used the site in the past. Only a small handful have left the site after creating an account, but almost all of those deserters said privacy concerns contributed to their decision to deactivate their accounts. Charlotte McGinn of Los Angeles said that \"after reading all of the news about Facebook's lack of concern for their users' data,\" she left the site for a second time, convinced that there were \"more than enough reasons to quit again.\" Despite these widespread concerns, most users are sticking with Facebook. And even outside of the site, they are using apps which access their Facebook data.  \n",

      "Less than half of respondents said they knew what apps could view their profile and activity on the social media site. Of those who checked, many reported that dozens of apps had access. For some, that number was even higher — at over 100 apps with some level of access to their Facebook data.  But users still try to limit what apps they allow in. Chicago's Reuben George says he will \"only allow apps that I trust and use.\" And Sarah Friesen from St. Louis said she tries to \"periodically review which apps are authorized and remove them if rarely used.\" \n",

      "Facebook's \"hard and confusing\" policies And while there are no signs yet of mass departures, the site's growth has been flat inside of the United States for the past two years. At this point, just about every American who wants a Facebook profile already has one. For Facebook, that means the only direction its U.S. user base can go is down. And as we noted above, nearly every respondent to our questionnaire who left Facebook said they did so because of data privacy concerns. But leaving the site is an extreme measure, and most users who responded said they try to find a balance between Facebook's convenience and its reliance on their personal data. Almost all respondents indicated that they take some measures to limit what others can see about them.  \n",

      "Many try to control their online audience. \"I limit what I post and make public,\" Carl Pittman told NPR. \"My posts are directed at my friends.\" Others avoid apps, websites and programs that request their data or seem suspicious. And one respondent even said she uses a private security company to lock down her personal data.  But respondents said they were unsure what options and settings they had available to protect their private information. Jennifer Socarras, from Georgia, said she tried to block Facebook's data collection but its policies were \"hard and confusing.\" Steven Begy of Rochester, N.Y., said he used the tools provided by Facebook, but added: \"I haven't done so in about 5 years, and who knows what has changed in that time.\" \"Tip of an iceberg?\" For many users, their concerns extend beyond the threat of identity theft or having their boss see an embarrassing photo. As the Cambridge Analytica episode illustrates, the data found on Facebook can be used in ways never predicted — or consented to — by its users.  \n",

      "Kristine Hester, a public school teacher near Chicago, says she needs to maintain a professional presence online. But she said she's \"increasingly concerned\" about the ways big data can be utilized, fearing that the information can be \"used to, essentially, create psychological weapons of culture war.\"  And this sentiment — that the current episode is a reflection of a broader technological shift — is common. \"Is this just an issue with Cambridge Analytica, or the tip of an iceberg?\" one respondent asked.  For Hester, it raises tough questions for the social media site. \"How does Facebook square its 'values' of promoting human connection with the unbelievable ease with which society utilized it (and other platforms) to sow discord and division?\" she asked.  \n",

      "The recent revelations that personal data from about 50 million Facebook users were used by a data analytics firm working for the Trump campaign are making a lot of the social network's users uneasy. Some are wondering if there's a better way to limit who can access their personal information. Shanna Carlile-Roy, a part time student living in a remote area of northern California, is on Facebook, but she's uncomfortable with its privacy policies. Yet she stays on the site. \"I feel trapped with the site because it's such a form of connection that I've become dependent on,\" she says. \n",

      "\n",
      "Carlile-Roy tries to use Facebook's privacy settings. But she says it's not so easy. \"You're expected to go and try to research it yourself, read through all the fine print and it's still really elusive,\" she says. \n",

      "There are a few things you can do. Let's start with apps. Cambridge Analytica, the firm with ties to the Trump campaign, got user data through a researcher who had an app. Apps are one way your Facebook information winds up outside of its walls. When you use an app for a game, a survey or anything, you're sharing your data. There is a way to stop this. Emory Roane of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse says \"users can and certainly should go to their Facebook page and check their connected apps.\" To do that, go to settings. Click on Apps. Click on Apps, Websites and Plugins. Then you can deny access to all apps by clicking \"disable platform.\" That's straightforward. If you don't want to deny all apps, you can deny access to certain details about yourself — your religion, your family connections, your interests. Just click on \"Edit\" for \"Apps Others Use.\" If you don't want Facebook following you around, Roane says, turn off location services. \"If it's asking for your location information all the time or when the app is up,\" he says, \"maybe set it to only when the app is up or disable it altogether.\" \n",

Still, Terrell McSweeny, a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, warns users not to be overly confident of keeping all their information private. There are certain details that will be made public on Facebook no matter what you do. \"Your name, your profile picture, your gender, your cover photos, your networks, your user name are always publicly available,\" McSweeny says. \"That's part of the policy of that website.\" \n",

You'd be spending your day full time dealing with Facebook.\" \n",

      "Chester does not think creating better privacy controls is the answer for consumers. \"I think for the average person there's nothing that one can do to protect their privacy,\" he says. Chester thinks Europe has the right idea. On May 25, a new law there will take effect allowing regulators there \"to be able to come down heavy on Facebook, Google and the others,\" Chester says. The companies will be required \"to get your permission first before they can use your data and create new limits on the ways that Facebook and Google and others operate,\" he adds. Chester says it will be interesting to see if the new rules in Europe hurt Facebook profits. In an interview earlier this week on CNN, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wouldn't object to some regulation of Facebook. But it seems unlikely he'd welcome what's about to happen in Europe. \n",

Almost half of the world's population is connected online. And technology is constantly looming in our lives: the Nest thermostat regulates our household temperature, a camera watches our dogs, our health is constantly monitored, and technology keeps our houses safe when we're at work. \n",

      "The Internet of things will continue to spread between now and 2026, until human and machine connectivity becomes ubiquitous and unavoidably present, according to experts who participated in what Pew described as a \"nonscientific canvassing.\" \n",

      "About 1,200 participants were asked: \"As automobiles, medical devices, smart TVs, manufacturing equipment and other tools and infrastructure are networked, is it likely that attacks, hacks or ransomware concerns in the next decade will cause significant numbers of people to decide to disconnect, or will the trend toward greater connectivity of objects and people continue unabated?\" The answers they gave were telling: 15 percent said significant numbers of people would disconnect while 85 percent said most people would just move more deeply into connected life. Survey Highlights Unplugging is futile, and plugging in is unavoidable. It's already difficult to create distance from the technology that surrounds us, but as connectivity increases, it might become impossible to do so. Marti Hearst, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, says just that. \n",

      "\"People's businesses, homes, cars and even their clothing will be monitoring their every move, and potentially even their thoughts,\" she says. \"Connected cities will track where and when people walk, initially to light their way, but eventually to monitor what they do and say. The walls of businesses will have tiny sensors embedded in them, initially to monitor for toxins and earthquakes, and eventually to monitor for intruders and company secrets being shared. People currently strap monitors on their bodies to tell them how many steps they take. Eventually, all fluids in and out of bodies will be monitored and recorded. Opting out will be out of the ordinary and hugely inconvenient, just as not carrying a mobile device and not using a fast pass on the highway are today.\" \n",

      "So once people are involved in the system, it's hard to get out of it. What if they didn't get involved at all? Judith Donath of Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society says that isn't actually a choice you get. \"People will move more deeply into connected life — and they also will be moved there whether they want to be or not,\" she says. \"The connection of the physical world to information networks enables the collection of an unimaginably vast amount of data about each of us, making it possible to closely model how we think and to devise increasingly effective ways of influencing how we act and what we believe. Attaining this ability is extraordinarily valuable to anyone with something to sell or promote.\" People crave connection and convenience over all else, and modern-day technology serves this well. People are used to risk, and most people believe bad things won't happen to them anyway. David Clark, a senior research scientist at MIT and Internet Hall of Fame member, says: \"Unless we have a disaster that triggers a major shift in usage, the convenience and benefits of connectivity will continue to attract users. Evidence suggests that people value convenience today over possible future negative outcomes.\" What about technology hacks, like WannaCry and the Mirai bot? Robert Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, says it probably won't bother users as much as you might expect. \"Most adults in the U.S. drive cars even though it entails risks,\" he says. \"Most adults will use IoT devices even though they involve risks because the benefits will vastly outweigh any potential risks. Moreover, as IoT progresses security will improve.\" The Internet of things might become safer over time. Many of the experts surveyed noticed that the Internet of things isn't particularly safe as-is, but will become safer as more people become aware of the issues. \n",

      "Amy Webb, futurist and CEO at the Future Today Institute, writes: \"Technology can be like junk food. We'll consume it, even when we know it's bad for us. There is no silver bullet. The only way to effectively prevent against malware and data breaches is to stay continually vigilant. To borrow an analogy from 'Game of Thrones,' we need a 'Night's Watch' for security. Because when it comes to the Internet of Things and data breaches, 'winter is coming.' Organizations must hire enough knowledgeable staff to monitor and adjust systems, and to empower them to keep pace with hackers. IT and security staff must be willing to educate themselves, to admit when they need help and to demand that executives make decisions proactively.\" \n",

      "Privacy has long been a moving target, thanks to technology. For much of humanity's history, privacy referred to the physical environment — who can see or hear you. Consider one of the most famous law review articles, called \"The Right To Privacy,\" penned in 1890 by Samuel Warren and future Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis. The matter at hand was the invention of instant photo cameras, which turned private meetings into potentially semi-public or fully public ones, says Alessandro Acquisti, a professor at the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University. These days, much of what we used to do privately isn't that private. We wear step-counting trackers. We document our meals, gatherings and whereabouts online. We let giant tech companies into our homes through voice-activated home assistants. \n",

      "Our boundaries have evolved, and \"privacy\" has become a term more tightly associated with our digital selves: the troves of data, the bits of our identities and activities, sprinkled through a myriad of databases. Now, the physical and digital are merging in the shape of Amazon Key, rolling out on Wednesday. The new product from the retail giant allows delivery couriers to drop packages inside homes. The $250 \"smart\" lock is linked to Amazon's Cloud Cam, which gets installed inside near the door. The pitch is convenience and, in fact, security: You can watch the courier enter the house on your phone, or use the lock to grant access to, say, a dog walker or cleaning crew. This follows a similar pitch from a company called Latch, which makes keyless \"smart\" locks. It has has partnered with Walmart's Jet.com to get packages into apartment buildings. From the companies' perspective, in-home deliveries are a solution to the problem of package theft. \"As a researcher, I am fascinated and curious to see indeed how many consumers will take advantage\" of Amazon Key, says Acquisti, \"because that will tell us something interesting about, to what extent we now trust corporations with both our digital data and our very real, very off-line, very physical lives, such as the entrance to your house?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon Key's intrusiveness — what with the camera inside your home and software controlling your door — faced skepticism as soon as it was announced in October. A Washington Post opinion column proclaimed it \"Silicon Valley at its most out-of-touch.\" Satirical newspaper The Onion ran with, \"Popular New Amazon Service Just Comes To Your House And Kills You.\" Several polls found a majority of Americans uncomfortable with the in-home delivery offer. \n",

      "But, as Acquisti puts it, we are constantly redrawing the boundaries of what we consider private. \"You can imagine a scenario where — someone who already has an Alexa (Amazon's home assistant) and they are already comfortable with Amazon collecting information about their behavior and preferences,\" says Mary Madden, a privacy researcher at the Data & Society Research Institute. Plus, there are other well-studied factors: We feel more comfortable revealing private details when we see other people in our circle doing it, and we do it more readily in a pinch — when you really need the app or the service and the company doesn't give you an easy out. Already observers are saying that Amazon Key could trigger the same major cultural shift — as Uber did for willingness to get into strangers' cars, or Airbnb did for staying at strangers' houses. To Madden, who is leery of Amazon Key, the major question is who's driving the cultural shift: Is it consumers demanding to trade off private details for more convenience, or companies making it very hard to resist? \"I don't think people are necessarily making fully informed decisions about all the implications of the use of (their) data. And I don't think they reasonably can,\" she says. Acquisti's research cleverly refers to this idea — consumers' efforts to stay on top of their own data privacy as companies keep pushing the envelope — as the task for \"a modern Sisyphus.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are in a time,\" says Madden, \"where even people who study these issues for a living can't keep up with all of the potential uses and implications.\"\n",

      "MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  Deceptive, evasive, unconvincing - these are some of the ways lawmakers here in Washington today described the CEO of TikTok. He was the sole witness in a five-hour hearing on whether Americans' data on the popular video-sharing app is safe.NPR's Bobby Allyn joins me to discuss how the CEO's performance might affect the future of TikTok. Hey, Bobby.BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise.KELLY: It sounds like a rocky day for the TikTok CEO. How did he go about defending the app before Congress?ALLYN: Yeah. So his name is Shou Chew. He's the CEO of TikTok, as you mentioned. And he told lawmakers that the Chinese government has never requested the data of Americans. And he made this point so many times, it's hard to count. When asked yes-or-no questions, he wouldn't bite. And instead, he would recite a fact. Lawmakers got really fed up with him. They kept interrupting him. They kept scoffing at him. They were scolding him. It was pretty intense.KELLY: How did he take that?ALLYN: Well, he mostly maintained his composure and didn't lose his temper, which I thought was pretty impressive. At one point, he said he just isn't able to prove a negative, then cracked a little smile and said, which I've been trying to do for hours now.A little bit about Chew - he was born and raised in Singapore, where he was an Army reservist before becoming an investment banker at Goldman Sachs. And now, of course, he leads TikTok. And he did have some fans in the room. There was an audience of TikTok influencers who rallied before the hearing to show support for the app. The company says it now has more than 150 million users in the U.S. That's half - almost half of the U.S. population. It's incredible. And Chew said TikTok has a company restructuring plan in place to build a firewall between the U.S. and China.KELLY: Yeah, that's what I want to ask about. Did we get details on that, and how did lawmakers receive this plan?ALLYN: Not well would be a nice way to put it. I mean, Chew came with his three or four talking points, but lawmakers just kept saying this sounds deceptive; it seems like you're dodging questions. And the really big sticking point, Mary Louise, was this - this new firewall that TikTok is building and loves talking about is supposed to make it a lot more difficult for Beijing-based employees to get their hands on Americans' data. But TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and TikTok share a ton of resources. They share engineering teams. They share a legal team. And ultimately, ByteDance is the boss of TikTok. Texas Republican Congressman Dan Crenshaw said he had this message for all the TikTokkers out there who think lawmakers are just out of touch and trying to take away young people's favorite app.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAN CRENSHAW: You may not care that your data is being accessed now, but it will be one day when you do care about it. And here's the real problem - with data comes power. They can choose what you see and how you see it. They can make you believe things that are not true. They can encourage you to engage in behavior that will destroy your life. Even if it is not happening yet, it could in the future.KELLY: All right. Well, let's stay with what might happen in the future. How might today's hearing influence whether TikTok has a future in the U.S.?ALLYN: Right. And that's the question, right? And it's hard to imagine that Chew made the situation any better for TikTok, to be honest. I mean, this comes as Congress is pursuing legislation that would enable President Biden to put TikTok out of business. And Chew said that shouldn't be necessary, right? He keeps insisting that TikTok has always taken national security concerns very seriously and that he and other members of TikTok's executive team have been negotiating for years with the White House to try to reach some kind of deal. And he says, look, I know I have to win over Americans' trust with TikTok. He told the congresspeople that, right? But he also admitted that Beijing employees, at least right now, are able to get their hands on Americans' personal information. Though, yes, they have a plan to put an end to it, but they could still access it now, right?But look, he ducked so many direct questions about how Chinese officials could try to use the app to manipulate the opinion of Americans. And, as we know, the Biden administration has ordered TikTok to sell to an American company, but the Chinese government is now pushing back, citing export control laws. So Mary Louise, the future of TikTok is very, very uncertain and likely to become even more uncertain after today.KELLY: NPR's Bobby Allyn. Thank you, Bobby.ALLYN: Thanks.\n",

      "NOEL KING, HOST:  Lawmakers in Washington talk a lot about reining in technology companies, but they're not really doing anything. So state legislatures are trying. They've advanced dozens of bills, but making law means going up against Silicon Valley and its lobbyists. Here's NPR's Bobby Allyn.BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Connecticut Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff was frustrated. Congress couldn't pass a bill protecting Americans' data, and he wanted Connecticut residents to know how and when they were being tracked online because right now, he says, there's a data privacy crisis.BOB DUFF: And that is known to any American who has a phone, laptop or tablet or any type of device where all of a sudden they mention something, next thing you know, there's an ad for it.ALLYN: So he introduced a bill last year that would allow people in Connecticut to opt out of data collection and to sue tech companies if they did it anyway. During a hearing for the bill, Duff looked around the room. It was packed. But he didn't see concerned citizens. Instead, he saw seat after seat filled with lobbyists paid by Facebook and Google and other tech companies.DUFF: Lobbyists put the fear of God in the people, even by saying something like this bill would harm data collection during a public health emergency, which is far from the truth, and it's actually inaccurate.ALLYN: His bill ultimately failed. The industry's leading trade group, the Internet Association, told Duff in a letter that the bill is, quote, \"of significant concern. Having the right to sue,\" the group wrote, \"would be a payday for trial lawyers and not help consumers safeguard their data.\" Now Duff has reintroduced the bill but caved by removing the right to sue tech companies. But he says he won't be giving up anything more otherwise...DUFF: We'll only really be lipstick on a pig from a standpoint of it's an industry-written bill that has data privacy in the headline. But other than that, it does nothing.ALLYN: Silicon Valley is setting up shop at state capitols across the country. Records show the big five tech companies have at least 14 registered lobbyists in Connecticut alone. It's a phenomenon that has been ramping up in recent years as states from Arkansas to Florida push bills looking to hem in the power of big tech. In response, the tech industry is pouring millions of dollars to get into the game of state politics.ASHKAN SOLTANI: For two decades, industry would argue that self-regulation is sufficient and not to meddle with the golden goose that's the internet.ALLYN: Ashkan Soltani is a data privacy advocate and a former Federal Trade Commission official. Now he says Silicon Valley views some type of regulation as unavoidable. Companies like Facebook have even publicly welcomed it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: We support updated internet regulations to set new standards for data portability, privacy and elections. Learn more at...ALLYN: Soltani is skeptical.SOLTANI: They're not doing it out of the goodness of their heart. You know, kind of like a taekwondo move, they want to capture that momentum and then direct it into something that benefits them.ALLYN: Several lobbyists and spokespeople for the companies declined to be interviewed for this story. Cathy Gellis, a San Francisco-area lawyer who specializes in tech policy, says some of the big tech pushback to state proposals has a point.CATHY GELLIS: You don't want the internet to become a you-can't-get-there-from-here type of place. And with local regulation, that's what we risk.ALLYN: She says regulations aimed at one thing can create unintended consequences someplace else for things like online commerce, speech and innovation. If companies have to follow one set of data tracking laws in one state and a whole other set in another, that's a nightmare for everyone. But it might just be what happens if Congress doesn't pass comprehensive internet reforms.Bobby Allyn, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF MARLEY CARROLL'S \"SEVEN CROWS\")\n",

      "These rules wouldn't have applied to the likes of Google or Facebook — massive data collectors and digital advertisers — and that has been a major point of contention for ISPs. But consumer groups argue that's no reason to roll back restrictions on Internet providers. Plus, they point out, you could abandon those companies in favor of other websites, if you disagree with their policies; switching Internet providers is not so easy. ISPs have long attempted to break into the ad-targeting and online marketing world, where the competition is intense. For context on what that market looks like, I turned to Jules Polonetsky, privacy expert and CEO of the Future of Privacy Forum, a nonprofit organization promoting responsible data collection. Below are excerpts of the interview, edited for clarity and length.  Interview Highlights On what's going on and what changes For the average consumer, just about every site they visit online is sharing data with other ad networks, with other third parties, for the purpose of either measuring or targeting ads. ... Even most privacy organizations end up using Google Analytics or some other basic tools. ... \n",

      " Use a virtual private network (VPN). Look for emails from your Internet service provider allowing you to opt out of ad-targeting programs. Turn on your browser's do-not-track feature. Clear or reset the ad ID on your smartphone. Turn off location-based ads on your iPhone. \n",

      "For better or worse, the predominant business model online has become ad-supported. ... So for the average user, the experience isn't likely to change one way or another — today they see ads targeted based on their activity; tomorrow they'll see ads based on their activity. Now, what choices people have maybe has gotten a little bit more complicated. ... ISPs have historically played a very small role in (the ad targeting) market for a range of reasons. The most interesting and valuable data is search, social media data — and that is typically only available to the big portals that have that data. The ISPs don't have it if it's encrypted. \n",

      "... The big challenge for big advertisers is that their audience is dispersed across laptop, and mobile, and tablet, and TV and elsewhere. And linking that user's identity is a challenge. ... And this is a place where ISPs are able to play a role. ... They now have something to offer — cross-device capabilities — that others can do, but others have to do it differently. ... On existing opt-out options The ad networks of the world offer an opt-out of ad targeting today. If there's a triangle \"i\" on your banner ad, that means that that company is tailoring ads based on your Web surfing and is offering you an opt-out. \n",

      "The BlueKai Bluebook, which is provided to potential advertisers, has 80 sources of data where Oracle's BlueKai data exchange has linked together data from Web surfing, from offline purchases, from all sorts of providers who have pulled data about you that they have online. ... So I've kind of looked at some of this debate with a bit of bemusement because I see the activity in these third-party data markets and that horse is out of that barn. I think for consumers who a more privacy-protective experience, there are a number of options, none of them are perfect — other than, perhaps using a VPN, which may not be easy for everyone to use. ... \n",

      "The good news is that an increasing amount of the activity online is encrypted, due to lots of advocacy. ... Increasingly, much of what you do is shielded from third parties because of encryption in place. The ISPs typically — in their efforts to use this data even before this (FCC) rule — have been providing consumers with ISP-level opt-outs. ... People should look for emails — typically they do push out an announcement when they roll out an ad-targeting program. On the regulatory oversight of privacy The FTC has generally been the lead privacy enforcer, and I think has been very aggressive at doing so. If you look at the recent Vizio case, they were able to take very strong action against sharing of your viewing history. ... At the end of the day, the willingness of the FCC and the FTC to use their authority effectively is what will determine whether the consumers are protected. The FCC (has in the past) used even its high-level authority very aggressively, and the FTC certainly historically has. We obviously don't know exactly how the new chairs will. ... On how ISPs' data collection compares to that of Google, Facebook and others The ad networks of the world typically share, swap and trade data via various exchanges. Google and Facebook have policies that to some degree use your data for ad targeting, but may limit the further use of it. For instance, Facebook does not want your Facebook data being shared — they'd like advertisers to come to Facebook to (place) ads on Facebook. \n",

      "That may be a nuance because ... to a consumer, data being used to tailor their experience is probably what makes a difference — whether it's being sold or used in a way that tracks and targets them. So the implementations that we see in the market of ISPs have focused on allowing the ISP to help ad network partners to do a better job of recognizing users. ... I think at the end of the day, for consumers, it ends up being parsing hairs. So the question is ... do the sites I visit get information that allows ads to be targeted based on other information about me? And that information isn't just Web browsing — a big part of ad-targeting today involves pinging on offline data, my actual purchases at a supermarket, my actual transactions. ... \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So what the advertisers are often looking to do is to work with partners who are able to put them and their offers in front of the users they want to reach. Sometimes, that's \"here's the Web browsing history,\" which they can get from an exchange, or they can get by going on one of the big portals, or presumably they'll be able to get by going to ISPs. The market doesn't think about it in terms of selling data — the market thinks about it in terms of \"how does an advertiser find the audience that it thinks it wants.\" ... And different providers in the market will create those audiences. On what users can do to restrict or entirely limit their data from being collected It pays to opt out of the behavioral advertising, when you see that triangle \"i,\" because thousands of companies will at least not target you — they may still be collecting data, but they're not gonna be tailoring the ads that you see. \n",

For the changes that have been made today, those tools are going to be effective, because the uses that the ISPs are likely to be interested are, frankly, these tailoring and targeting uses — and so (these tools) for most people are going to be reasonable. They're not going to promise you absolute privacy, but neither would have the FCC rule. ... If you're really looking to disengage from the commercial world, it's hard to take advantage of much of the Web without being fairly technically savvy. ... If today's vote allows ISPs broader latitude with how they can use data, primarily for advertising and marketing uses, most of these tools will turn off those functions.

      "It's becoming increasingly clear that the end of Roe will look vastly different than before Roe — in large part because of the role of data.  Since the Supreme Court ruled that abortion access wasn't a constitutional right, several states states have already enacted bans out of the two dozen states that are expected to ban or restrict the procedure. The court ruling has prompted a wave of women to delete their menstrual cycle apps out of worry about potentially incriminating themselves in the future. On social media, some have encouraged using coded language when posting about abortion access as a way to avert law enforcement's attention. And in Congress, some Democratic lawmakers are working on plans to better protect people's personal data as it relates to reproductive health.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Although there's still a lot that's still unknown about how or what kinds of data will be used as evidence, digital privacy advocates are encouraging both abortion seekers and supporters to err on the side of caution.  \"The depth of information about us that the police can try to access in investigations is unprecedented in human history,\" said Nathan Wessler, the deputy project director of the Speech, Privacy and Technology Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.  \n",

      "\"We are likely to see in states that are banning abortion, really invasive investigations into people who are seeking medical care,\" he added. Data may be used against anyone seeking reproductive care It's not just call histories, text messages and emails that may be used to prosecute, but also location data, online payment records, Google searches and fertility tracking apps, data experts predict.  That list may only begin to scratch the surface because when it comes to personal data, it's still unclear how much we produce and who can see it.  \"We live in a digital age when our activities, our movements, our transactions and our communications leave a digital trail,\" Wessler said. \"And it is extraordinarily hard to eliminate all of the digital trails that might be of interest to law enforcement.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He also worries that a wide spectrum of people seeking reproductive care will be subject to invasive, digital investigations by the police.  \"A woman who shows up in an emergency room after a miscarriage may suddenly be subject to police digging through her every digital communication record to figure out whether it's a miscarriage or not,\" he added. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital privacy advocate, says that period tracking apps don't pose the most immediate danger for women seeking abortions in states where they are banned. Rather, the group mentions text messages, browser histories and emails as being more commonly used in criminal investigations. The group recommends using encryption and being aware of your phone's privacy settings. Personal data may be in the hands of bounty hunters  In some states, it won't just be law enforcement who can get their hands on people's personal data.  So far, Texas, Oklahoma and Idaho have passed citizen-enforced abortion bans, meaning anyone can file a civil lawsuit if they believe an abortion was performed and possibly win at least $10,000. \n",

      "This bounty system will also allow plaintiffs to request troves of data in order to build their case, according to Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at EFF. Although there's still a lot to understand about who may be sued or what kinds of digital investigations may take place, Galperin adds that there's a risk in the uncertainty.  \"It's terrifying,\" said Galperin. \"Suddenly, if you're doing abortion support, it's much harder to know who to trust.\" Pregnant people of color may be under great digital surveillance  What's left some privacy experts on edge is how much is unknown about how the growing number of state laws that criminalize abortions will be enforced. \"They are often broad and vaguely written, and this was their purpose,\" said Galperin. \"And the reason for that is because they want people who are seeking abortions and providing abortion support to assume the worst and therefore, not act.\" \n",

      "Galperin believes the threat of digital surveillance won't stop people from seeking or supporting such procedures but it will pose great risk for those seeking care and disproportionately impact pregnant women of color.  \"People of color have always been the guinea pigs for surveillance and for cracking down on any kind of unwanted behavior in the United States,\" Galperin said.  Wessler adds that the degree of tech savviness, time and effort required to avoid leaving a digital footprint might not be achievable to some, which is why he believes the federal government needs to do a better job in protecting pregnant people in crisis.  \n",

      "Viewed out of context, recent Washington revelations paint a disturbing portrait of the vast amount of electronic data the nation's spy agencies are collecting. But the blockbuster news stories belie a simple truth: Personal privacy rights have been under sustained assault since well before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. And it's not just government that's vacuuming up information. Dating to the early 1990s, growth in electronic commerce has been facilitated and driven by advances in data collection and storage. What we read, where we live, what we buy, whom we call, what music we listen to, what movies we watch in our homes, the names of childhood pets and mothers' maiden names — all of it, and much more, now lives on a server farm somewhere For the most part, Americans haven't loudly objected to this slow erosion of privacy: Much of our personal information has been surrendered willingly as a result of our eagerness to connect through social media and our ravenous consumption habits. What many consumers don't know, however, is how aggressively Big Tech has moved to track and combine the data to build user profiles. As for the growth of the national security state and its snooping habits, even as its tentacles have expanded there have been few signs of political backlash. \n",

      "Here are some notable milestones over the past two decades that help explain how we got to this point: 1994: The birth of the cookie Netscape is credited with inventing the browser \"cookie,\" the innocently named little computer file that enables firms to build a profile of a user by recognizing and tracking his or her Web surfing behavior. 1995: The European Union sounds an alarm Against the backdrop of long-standing, pre-Internet concerns about privacy and the protection of personal data, the EU issues its first data protection directive regarding the processing of personal data and its free movement. 1997: What privacy policy? The Electronic Privacy Information Center reviews 100 of the most frequently visited Internet sites and reports in June 1997 that only 17 have explicit privacy policies. None meet basic standards for privacy protection, according to the public interest research center. \"We were not able to determine whether web sites are linking data collected on-line with other databases,\" wrote EPIC. \"This classic computer matching technique is oftentimes one of the first indicators of a privacy problem. It is also likely to emerge as a significant issue in the near future.\" 1999: Big Brother zeroes in  The first commercially available GPS phone is launched by mobile phone manufacturer Benefon and sold mainly in Europe. Even before such GPS-enabled mobile phones are widely available in the U.S., in August 2001 PCWorld magazine asks, \"Will Big Brother Track You by Cell Phone?\" \n",

      "2001: The Sept. 11 era begins Six weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush signs the Patriot Act into law. The bill, which grants broad new surveillance powers to law enforcement and intelligence agencies, is designed \"to identify, to dismantle, to disrupt and to punish terrorists before they strike.\" After passing both the House and Senate by wide margins, the Patriot Act widens the scope of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, and includes a variety of provisions that allow for expanded data collection and surveillance by government, as well as disclosure of electronic communications. \n",

Aside from concerns over its scope, the Orwellian ring to the program's name proves problematic. Within months of the initial headlines revealing its existence, it's changed to a less threatening moniker: \"Terrorism Information Awareness.\" 2005: Warrantless surveillance The New York Times reports in December 2005: \"Months after the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans and others inside the United States to search for evidence of terrorist activity without the court-approved warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying, according to government officials. \"Under a presidential order signed in 2002, the intelligence agency has monitored the international telephone calls and international e-mail messages of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people inside the United States without warrants over the past three years in an effort to track possible 'dirty numbers' linked to Al Qaeda, the officials said. The agency, they said, still seeks warrants to monitor entirely domestic communications.\" \n",

      "2006: Facebook launches News Feed In September 2006, Facebook, the popular social networking service, launches its new News Feed feature, which broadcasts changes members make to their Web profiles to the pages of others in their Facebook social networks. After an uproar, fueled by complaints about the invasiveness of the feature, Facebook quickly apologizes and lets users disable or modify it. A year later, Facebook again angers users with the introduction of Beacon, a program that sends news alerts to users' friends about which goods and services they purchased online. After widespread criticism and a class-action lawsuit, Beacon is shut down in late 2009. \n",

      "2007: Google launches Street View A new feature of Google Maps, Street View enables users to view and navigate within 360-degree panoramic street-level imagery of various U.S. cities. \"With Street View users can virtually walk the streets of a city, check out a restaurant before arriving, and even zoom in on bus stops and street signs to make travel plans,\" says Google in a May 29 announcement. The remarkably detailed imagery immediately sparks a privacy debate, but it takes a back seat to a later revelation that Google's Street View cars — the ones taking the photos — had also collected sensitive personal information from wireless home networks. The company tells Federal Trade Commission investigators that it had mistakenly collected the data. \"We are mortified by what happened, but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users,\" the company explains. Google outlines the problem and the plans to fix it in a blog post. 2008: FISA amended Congress passes the FISA Amendments Act in July 2008, expanding the federal government's surveillance powers and giving immunity to telecom companies that assist in a warrantless surveillance program. 2009: Facebook changes the rules Tens of thousands of Facebook users protest against terms of service changes that allow Facebook to use anything uploaded to the site at any time, even after users have deleted their profiles and left Facebook. After the backlash, the company reverts to its original policy and issues a statement of rights and responsibilities surrounding its relationship with users. 2011: Bad Buzz Google agrees to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it used deceptive tactics and violated its own privacy promises to consumers when it launched its social network Google Buzz in 2010.

That’s why states are suing Meta.Because Congress hasn’t acted, the majority of our states are trying to use lawsuits to force Meta to make changes.The Facebook Developers Conference in San Jose, Calif., in 2019.David Paul Morris / Bloomberg via Getty Images fileOct. 27, 2023, 12:12 AM UTCBy Jessica Levinson, MSNBC ColumnistLast year, Congress considered, but didn’t pass, the Kids Online Safety Act and failed to update the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act. The Kids Online Safety Act would have required companies to undergo regular external audits of the risks their platforms create for minors, implement stronger privacy settings for minors and bear the burden of ensuring they mitigate foreseeable harms like posts boosting substance abuse, eating disorders or suicide.There is plenty of evidence to indicate that time spent on social media is linked to increased depression, anxiety and self-esteem issues for kids and teens.There is plenty of evidence to indicate that time spent on social media is linked to increased depression, anxiety and self-esteem issues for kids and teens. In some cases, cyberbullying and harassment have even been linked to children’s deaths. Congressional inaction has exacerbated the dangers faced by children and teens who use social media and led to a predictable vacuum. Now more than three dozen states are seeking to fill that vacuum by suing Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. They accuse Meta of violating a federal privacy law and of violating their state consumer protection laws. Separate but similar lawsuits make nearly identical claims against Meta based solely on state laws. California and dozens of other blue and red states have alleged that Meta has lied about the safety of its social media sites and therefore violated state consumer protection laws. Specifically, the states allege that the social media sites are products that are designed to “induce young users’ compulsive and extended use.” Essentially, the lawsuit claims that Meta’s platforms are designed to addict minors, and others, to their products (much like slot machines) and that once they are on those platforms, the algorithms present minors with dangerous and harmful content.The states claim that Meta knows full well that its platforms are causing children harm. Two years ago, a former Facebook employee leaked research showing that using Instagram can directly harm teenage girls. The research specifically involved content seen to detrimentally affect girls’ body images and self-esteem. CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded by saying that the research had been misconstrued and that his products weren’t designed to promote harmful or angry content.The plaintiffs have also claimed that Meta collects the personal data of its minor users, in violation of the federal children’s online privacy law. Meta’s guidelines provide that it collect from a minor's accounts only data that is “needed for their device to work properly.” Ideally, minors would stay off of social media entirely, or for at least for the vast majority of their time. But we all know that isn’t going to happen. Social media sites are too tempting and ubiquitous. The next best option would be for companies to take real and concrete steps to implement safety and privacy protections for younger users. And while Meta has implemented some reforms, like increasing parental controls and age verification technology and removing certain sensitive content, there is more that can be done. Content moderation that quickly removes posts that support bullying, harassment or suicide should be more robust. “We want this activity to stop using its misleading algorithms,” Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers said at a news conference Tuesday. “We want to make sure it applies with the COPPA,” he said, referring to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.When children are facing real harm and private companies don’t appear to be remedying that harm fast enough, lawmakers should step in.Not every problem requires a legislative fix. But when children are facing real harm and private companies don’t appear to be remedying that harm fast enough, lawmakers should step in. This is also a situation that cries out for federal regulation, because we need one uniform set of standards throughout the country. Simply by virtue of how the internet works, having a patchwork of laws that vary by state could present real administrative hurdles. While neither the Kids Online Safety Act nor the Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act was perfect (critics contend that the proposals would “increase surveillance and restrict access to information”), lawmakers should re-introduce them and mandate that social media companies limit the time and frequency with which certain users can use their platforms and, perhaps most importantly, change the algorithms for which content is pushed to younger users.   Because Congress hasn’t acted, the majority of our states are trying to use lawsuits to force Meta to make changes.Meta will almost certainly respond to these suits by alleging that another federal law, the Communications Decency Act, and specifically Section 230 of that act, protects social media companies from being sued for content users post on their platforms. It is well past time for Congress to update this federal law, which was passed in 1996, when the internet was in its infancy. The states have tried to circumvent the protections granted by Section 230 by suing under state consumer protection laws and therefore not targeting the content of the posts on Meta’s platforms, instead taking issue with how those platforms are designed and how Meta has allegedly lied about their harmful effects.We don’t know whether Meta’s defense will be successful, but we do know that in 1996, Congress didn’t and couldn’t predict the growth of social media companies and the accompanying dangers that have resulted. That’s why this section of the law must be updated to fit our current time. Our children are facing a mental health crisis. Teen depression has doubled over the last decade. Is this solely the result of time spent on social media? Of course not. But the evidence makes it hard to escape the conclusion that social media is contributing to it. This is a situation that screams out for lawmakers to create a baseline of standards to protect the youngest members of our society from foreseeable harm while ensuring that children’s privacy is also protected. The details of such legislation may be complicated, but the reasons it’s needed are not. And no need to wonder whether President Joe Biden would sign such legislation. He has called for it in his State of the Union addresses for the past two years.   Jessica LevinsonJessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, is the host of the \"Passing Judgment\" podcast.

Li, MSNBC ColumnistTwenty years have passed since Sept. 11, 2001, a day that upended American life as we knew it and started us on a series of ever-newer “normals.” After the Sept. 11 attacks, Americans accepted a marked increase in government control, including the Patriot Act, which allowed for an expansion of government surveillance powers.Despite what some privacy alarmists might say, we did not lose all our privacy rights after 9/11.In 2021, on the heels of America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, amid a growing trend of climate disasters and as our nation still battles a raging pandemic, we find ourselves in yet another state of emergency. We do not live in an Orwellian dystopia yet. But this time, we cannot give up our hard-earned rights for what may be a never-ending series of emergencies.We accepted many mundane privacy violations, including airport screenings by the newly created Transportation Security Administration. But we also accepted more worrisome, larger-scale, longer-term privacy invasions, including the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of data from telephone records. In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, we even seemingly accepted discrimination against our fellow Americans, including Muslim Americans and other Black and brown Americans who became collateral damage in an unending war on a faceless enemy.\n",
      "Despite what some privacy alarmists might say, we did not lose all our privacy rights after 9/11. We did, however, accept government privacy invasions in the name of national security and public safety. But that doesn’t answer why we also have seemingly accepted a sharp increase in corporate surveillance and the increasingly harmful data ecosystem that has developed through the advent of the internet and connected technologies.The rise of the internet, mobile devices and connected technologies has created a data ecosystem where we willingly give up our private information to countless faceless companies. Social media platforms such as Facebook scoop up our posts and our user behavior data. Google scans our emails. Amazon tracks our shopping history.Countless other companies harvest our data or purchase it from data aggregators. Our data can be used against us, and the current privacy laws do not do enough to protect against the aggregated data harms of today’s connected world. The United States doesn’t even have a federal privacy law.In the past 20 years, not only have we witnessed an explosion in government and corporate surveillance, but we have also seen an increase in public-private surveillance partnerships. Amazon now partners with over 2,000 law enforcement agencies in the nation, with agreements that involve the sharing of video and audio data from Ring cameras owned by private individuals.Facial recognition company Clearview AI has been accused of selling surveillance technologies abroad, with little government oversight.Facial recognition company Clearview AI has been accused of selling surveillance technologies abroad, with little government oversight. When we export such technology, we run the risk of supporting oppressive regimes that may then use it to stamp down political dissent, oppress minorities and commit human rights abuses. Clearview's CEO has acknowledged interest from other countries but says the company is \"very much focused on the U.S. and Canada\" and that it would not do business inside countries that are \"very adverse to the U.S.\"We need better and stronger laws to protect privacy and individual rights, especially during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Twenty years ago, we surrendered privacy rights for national security and safety. Today, we may be surrendering even more privacy rights for the cause of public health.Safety and public health are important, and it is critical that the government protect both. However, just as 9/11 changed the way we thought about privacy and civil liberties, today, the pandemic is changing the way we evaluate the tradeoffs between protecting individual rights and protecting public health.We mustn’t lose sight of the importance of privacy in safeguarding our freedom and autonomy. There is still time to fight for our rights against both government and corporate intrusion and to protect our privacy and other civil liberties before it’s too late.We can’t go back to the days before the pandemic or before 9/11. However, we can create a better “new normal.” We can stop exporting surveillance technologies to countries where we know the tech will be used to commit atrocities. We can impose stricter standards on privacy and require protections of civil liberties for corporations and our government. We can pass a federal privacy law. We can work with like-minded nations to raise the bar for privacy and human rights worldwide, setting new norms and legal standards for the world — thereby helping not only our fellow Americans but the entire human race.We can do this because, despite the rise in surveillance since 9/11 and the new corporate-driven data ecosystem, we still live in a free democracy. We have the right to speak freely and raise our voices for what we believe in, even if it involves curtailing the power of the government. We have a free market that allows us to vote with our wallets and a fair electoral process that allows us to choose the people who govern us.Privacy and civil liberties are the bedrock of our democracy. We must do better not only for ourselves, but because the rest of the world is watching. If we can protect privacy, freedom and democracy in America, we help the cause of democracy and freedom worldwide, now and in the future. That future is worth fighting for, always.Tiffany C.

Li, MSNBC ColumnistAmazon announced its plans to acquire iRobot, maker of the popular Roomba robotic vacuums, just weeks after the company announced it was acquiring One Medical, a tech-forward concierge medical company.With the acquisition of companies that provide personal services, such as medical or in-home cleaning devices, for example, Amazon stands to obtain massive amounts of personal data, a valuable commodity in today’s climate. The scary part is that our current laws do not protect us from the compounded privacy risks that arise when corporate behemoths own so much of our personal information.Amazon has shared consumer Ring video footage with law enforcement without user permission at least 11 times so far this year.In just under three decades, Amazon has grown from a scrappy e-commerce startup to a multifaceted corporate goliath. In addition to the e-commerce business that first launched Amazon into the tech stratosphere, Amazon now owns a number of subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, Ring and Whole Foods. From a privacy standpoint, this means that Amazon already has direct access to vast quantities of consumer data, from your Whole Foods shopping history to your Amazon Prime watchlist to raw video fed directly from Ring cameras installed on your (or your neighbor’s) front door.Acquisitions of more companies and services will only lengthen its reach into consumers’ personal lives. iRobot’s home cleaning products include smart vacuums and mops that can map out the layout of your entire home. When combined with Amazon Echo’s always-on voice assistants, plus Ring’s video surveillance, Amazon will soon have the potential to be fully enmeshed in every part of your home. One Medical runs a network of subscription-based health care clinics, which means that Amazon will soon get its hands on One Medical’s stores of private user data related to health information.The ultimate question is, what happens when our data falls into the wrong hands? The short answer is that our legal system simply does not yet have a solution in place. It is always a mistake to give up our privacy in exchange for convenience.Amazon hasn’t always been the best steward of its consumer data. For example, the company recently admitted that Amazon has shared consumer Ring video footage with law enforcement without user permission at least 11 times so far this year. Amazon has also allowed police use of Rekognition, its flawed facial recognition program, though the company banned this practice indefinitely in June 2020.Even if Amazon tries to protect consumer privacy over profits (there is no promise that it will), there are still risks involved with any mass collection of consumer data, especially at this enormous scale. Malicious third parties can hack into corporate systems and expose consumer information. Data brokers and aggregators can buy and repackage data from multiple sources, compounding the risks of reidentification of personal information, making it more likely that information that was once private can be linked to individuals.And Amazon isn’t the only tech giant using strategic mergers and acquisitions to consolidate and grow its access to personal data. In the past, Meta (the company formerly known as Facebook) received backlash for consolidating its market power through acquisitions of WhatsApp (messaging), Instagram (social media) and Oculus (virtual reality gaming). Alphabet Inc. (Google’s parent company) has also branched out in the past, with acquisitions as diverse as self-driving car company Waymo and health care wearable company Fitbit.Current privacy laws do not fully protect our privacy rights, especially at a time when tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet are buying up all our data.Current privacy laws do not fully protect our privacy rights, especially at a time when tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet are buying up all our data. We currently have no federal privacy law and thus no baseline regulation that provides standardized protections for privacy across all 50 states. Instead, we have a patchwork system of state laws and regulations that vary by industry, making it difficult for any company, giant or not, to fully comply with all privacy regulations.For example, in the health care industry, you might have heard of HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. However, what you might not know is that HIPAA is incredibly limited and only protects certain kinds of health information when electronically transmitted in scenarios involving a select category of health care provider. HIPAA is not a broad regulation that protects health privacy in all cases. There are also exceptions to HIPAA that allow law enforcement to access to medical records, something that came up recently in a Nebraska case in which law enforcement obtained access to records from Facebook and from a health care provider in order to prosecute a teen and her mom for performing an at-home abortion.Recently, both Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., separately called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the One Medical deal for potential antitrust violations. It’s true that the FTC and the Justice Department should look into these Amazon deals for anti-competition reasons, as Amazon continues to consolidate its market power across sectors. But Amazon’s recent acquisitions do not only raise issues of market competition and power imbalance; they also highlight privacy risks we cannot ignore any longer.Our current privacy regulatory regime is not enough to protect our fundamental right of privacy. We need comprehensive privacy legislation on a federal level, and we need to make sure that any new federal privacy law includes special protections for sensitive categories of data, including personal health information. We also need legislative protection against government abuse of access to consumer data to protect against unreasonable searches that violate our constitutional right to privacy.The more of our private data these tech giants own, the more they will be able to invade our privacy. Even worse, the more this happens, the more we also begin to expect that our privacy will be invaded. Over time, we normalize these privacy violations, so much so that eventually, our society stops believing in privacy. By not protecting privacy today, we may risk losing privacy forever.Tiffany C.

Li, MSNBC ColumnistApple recently announced a new suite of features to combat the spread of child sexual abuse material. Everyone agrees that child safety is important and that companies must do more to protect children online. But no technology is ever neutral — not even with the lofty goal of safeguarding children from predators.As advocates warned, Apple's initiative could be the start of a wave of privacy violations, setting a dangerous precedent for the future of digital privacy rights. The fact is that we need more transparency from Apple about how these policies will be put into practice and strong guardrails, both corporate and regulatory, to prevent abuse of these new features.The initiative is spread out through three new features, two of which raised red flags for privacy advocates. The first is a tool to automatically scan photos stored on users' devices before they are uploaded to iCloud. It will then compare those images with a database of child sexual abuse images hosted by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, a private nonprofit organization established by Congress in 1984. If a match is found, law enforcement may be notified.The other controversial new feature will flag sexually explicit photos sent or received by minors using the Messages app, with an option for parents to receive notifications if their children view flagged photos. While that sounds like a helpful tool for parents, it may also lead to other risks.For starters, the flagging feature could lead to discriminatory effects due to algorithmic bias in how the feature chooses which images to flag. For example, Instagram recently faced backlash when it introduced explicit content filters, which some argue lead to discriminatory blocking or downranking of posts by certain creators of marginalized races, genders and backgrounds.The public deserves more transparency about how Apple plans to identify problematic images and what algorithms it plans to use for this feature.This feature could even lead to greater abuse of vulnerable children, including potentially outing LGBTQ children to homophobic families. As legal scholar and advocate Kendra Albert put it, \"These 'child protection' features are going to get queer kids kicked out of their homes, beaten, or worse.\" Children in abusive homes may also be prevented from sharing photographic evidence of their abuse by the parental notification feature.The good news is that the parental notification feature will be available only for children under 13, and minor users will be informed that the notification setting is on. In addition, both the risks and the benefits of the Messages scanning feature may be limited, as users can easily use any number of other messaging apps to evade the content flagging and parental notification.Regardless, the public deserves more transparency about how Apple plans to identify problematic images and what algorithms it plans to use for this feature.The device scanning feature is even worse. Currently, many tech platforms include some safety features that monitor content for child sexual abuse material, often reporting directly to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. However, most of these safety mechanisms scan content that is shared to servers or posted to sites. In contrast, Apple's safety tool would scan photos saved to users' devices. Doing so would by definition decrease users' control over who can access information stored on their devices, which has a much higher risk of future abuse.While Apple may mean well, it's not hard to imagine how this safety feature could lead to even greater privacy incursions in the future. Today, the justification is child safety. Tomorrow, the justification might be counterterrorism or public health or national security. When we begin giving up our digital rights, it is hard to turn the clock back and bring back past protections.Even worse, Apple's device scanning feature could open the door to abuse by other parties, including state actors. Governments around the world have long called for \"backdoor\" access to applications and devices — built-in access that would get around standard security measures (like encryption) and allow governments to view, manipulate or control the data and devices you own.Governments, including illiberal and authoritarian governments, may see this preloaded device scanning feature as a tool they can use for their own ends. This could lead to devastating consequences, not only for our privacy but also for the privacy of people living in nondemocratic countries where rights are already severely limited. Think of the spyware abilities that the NSO group, an Israeli company, provided to governments supposedly to track terrorists and criminals, which some countries then used to monitor activists and journalists.Now imagine those same abilities hard-coded into every iPhone and Mac computer on the planet. Apple's new features aren't quite as invasive, but the NSO Group example shows how corporations and governments can easily abuse access to data and devices.Apple has already responded to privacy advocates' concerns in an FAQ posted to its site: \"We have faced demands to build and deploy government-mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before, and have steadfastly refused those demands. We will continue to refuse them in the future.\"Apple has also promised to refuse demands from governments to add other types of images to the list of images that would be flagged. This is encouraging, and we should commend Apple for its pledge. However, the fact remains that any system that collects data can suffer from vulnerabilities that lead to unwanted access, including access by authoritarian governments.It is true that Apple has, in the past, resisted government demands to access devices and data, including during its high-profile 2016 legal dispute with the FBI. Investigators demanded that Apple unlock an iPhone recovered from one of the suspects in the 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California; Apple refused. The company has also repeatedly used privacy as a market differentiator, advertising itself as the \"good\" tech company that preserves users' privacy, in contrast to Facebook, Google, Amazon and the rest.Apple's new safety features may help curb the spread of child sexual abuse material and online and offline exploitation of children. However, it is just as likely that the bad actors they're trying to deter will get around these new features by eschewing Messages and iCloud in favor of other messaging and cloud storage services. What we may end up with are new software tools that are both ineffective and harmful to our privacy rights.Child safety and privacy are key concerns for any tech company, and Apple must be accountable on both fronts. The fact that a few new features by a single company can create so much impact on fundamental rights shows once again why we need stronger privacy laws and why Congress needs to act to pass a federal privacy law as soon as possible.CORRECTION (Aug. 12, 2021, 4:45 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misattributed this quote: \"These 'child protection' features are going to get queer kids kicked out of their homes, beaten, or worse.\" It is from Kendra Albert, a clinical instructor at Harvard's Cyberlaw Clinic, not Kendra Serra.Tiffany C.

If you’re reading this column, chances are these changes could affect you.  Under our current legal framework, established over a quarter century ago (that’s about 200 years in internet-age years), huge technology companies such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are largely immune from being sued for content that users post on those sites. That means if you want to pop over to Facebook and post some defamatory statements about me, I can, with very few exceptions, sue you — but not Facebook. If you’re reading this column, chances are these changes could affect you.  But the Supreme Court should not be the body to balance those interests. This week, the court is hearing oral arguments in two cases which ask when, under federal law, tech companies can face legal consequences for content on their sites. But, as a number of the justices repeatedly discussed during oral arguments in one of the cases, the court shouldn’t be the institution fashioning new rules for a new internet age. The court shouldn’t be the one creating new rules to balance the desire to protect tech companies, and prevent a floodgate of litigation, with the potential need to impose some liability on these giants. The court is interpreting federal statutes, not the Constitution, and therefore it is well within Congress’ purview to enact these changes. In fact, our representatives’ responsibility is to update our laws to reflect changing technology. But because Congress appears mired in indecision, the court may be the one to reshape the rules for social media giants. The issue in the first case, Gonzalez v. Google LLC, is whether a federal law protects social media companies from liability when those companies make recommendations to users about other users’ content or amplify certain content. Imagine that based on previous videos you have watched, YouTube, owned by Google, recommends additional videos. If, for instance, you’ve watched four YouTube videos on knitting, chances are YouTube’s algorithm might conclude that you’d like to watch a fifth. Currently, that federal law, Section 230(c)(1) of the Communications Decency Act, immunizes social media giants from liability when they do things such as decide whether to post or take down certain content. The question is how far that legal protection stretches and whether it includes decisions to recommend and amplify other users’ content. In this case, the family of an American killed in an Islamic State terrorist group attack in 2015 in Paris sued YouTube (again, owned by Google) claiming that by directing users to certain content, YouTube was helping ISIS’ recruitment activities.  The second case deals with similar questions but comes at it from a different legal lens. In Twitter v. Taamneh, the general legal issue is whether social media companies can be liable under a different federal law, Section 2333 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, for aiding and abetting terrorism due to a terrorist group’s posting on the site. The specific question asks whether Twitter could be viewed as providing substantial assistance to terrorists by failing to take more aggressive steps to prevent them from using Twitter. This case was also brought by a family whose relative was killed by an ISIS attack abroad, this one in Istanbul in 2017. We know that at least four justices voted to consider these cases (it takes four justices to agree to hear a case). This means four justices were interested in revisiting the laws that largely immunize social media companies from content that others post on their sites. The increasingly influential Justice Clarence Thomas has written about wanting to limit the protections given to social media companies under our current legal framework. We always need to be careful about reading too much into the justices’ questions at oral arguments. Having said that, after oral arguments in the Google case, it appears increasingly unlikely that the court will use these cases to upend our current legal framework. There seemed to be interest in either kicking the case back to lower courts to apply new judicial standards or kicking this to our legislative branch to strike the proper balance on these questions.  If the Supreme Court does, in fact, shrink protections for social media companies, users can expect more aggressive content moderation, which would be the only way for companies to avoid the threat of constant litigation. The question is how far that legal protection stretches and whether it includes decisions to recommend and amplify other users’ content. In a social media world awash in misinformation  and disinformation, more content moderation on social media may sound like good news. There is, however, an important distinction here between less disinformation and less speech. One is a goal, another is a sign of an unraveling democracy. Ultimately, as some of the justices themselves seemed to acknowledge, we want the people closest to “we the people,” our representatives, to craft new laws for a new world. As Justice Elena Kagan jokingly pointed out in oral arguments in the Google case, “We’re a Court. We really don’t know about these things. These are not, like, the nine greatest experts on the internet.” It’s time to update rules written before we gave new meaning to words such as tweets, reels and grams. But that should be done after input from various stakeholders. Yes, this means holding congressional hearings, drafting legislation and voting. It shouldn’t mean oral arguments and opinion drafting. Congress, take the wheel.  Jessica LevinsonJessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, is the host of the \"Passing Judgment\" podcast.
