Americans saw a number of viral moments during Thursday's House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing focused on security concerns surrounding the use of TikTok in the U.S.     During the hearing, lawmakers questioned TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew over allegations the platform may be being used by China to spy on Americans, its ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and the inappropriate content contained within it.In one viral moment, Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., played a video posted by one TikTok user who threatened to shoot up the hearing, specifically naming members of the committee, that has remained viewable for 41 days.  TIKTOK CEO TELLS ‘ALMOST HALF’ OF US ON CHINESE APP POLITICIANS ‘COULD TAKE TIKTOK AWAY FROM ALL 150M OF YOU’  In the video, a cartoon of a handgun can be seen firing bullets with the caption, \"Me asf at the House Energy and Commerce Committee on 3/23/2023.\"  Cammack noted the video was in violation of TikTok's safety guidelines, and questioned how Chew and the leadership of the platform were capable of protecting Americans' data if they were incapable of policing such content.  The logo of ByteDance app TikTok. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)In another instance, Rep. Neal Dunn, R-Fla., asked Chew if ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, had \"spied on American citizens,\" but the CEO didn't give a direct answer.  \"I don't think that spying is the right way to describe it,\" he responded. TIKTOK DEPLOYS SWARM OF INFLUENCERS TO US CAPITOL AHEAD OF EXPECTED CEO GRILLING  At a separate point in the hearing, Rep. Bob Latta, R-Ohio, pressed Chew over whether employees at ByteDance had access to Americans' user data. He avoided directly answering the question, telling Latta it was a \"complex topic.\"    \"Yes or no? It's not that complex. Yes or no? Do they have access to U.S. data?\" Latta said. Chew then appeared to admit China did have access to such data up until a certain point.BLINKEN SUGGESTS TIKTOK ‘SHOULD BE ENDED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER’On another occasion, Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., pressed Chew on whether he agreed that the Chinese government had persecuted the country's Uyghur minority population in the country's western region of Xinjiang.     Chew responded by saying that all human rights abuses were \"deeply concerning\" to hear about, before Lesko interrupted him and asked him again specifically about the Uyghurs. Chew, again, didn't answer the question, and ultimately avoided answering a total of four times.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP   Brandon Gillespie is an associate editor at Fox News.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he believes in the idea of healthy competition and making sure \"the playing field is level for all,\" in a prepared statement he plans to give before federal lawmakers on Wednesday.    \"Our story would not have been possible without U.S. laws that encourage competition and innovation,\" he said in a statement obtained by Fox News from someone close to the hearing process. \"I believe that strong and consistent competition policy is vital because it ensures that the playing field is level for all. At Facebook, we compete hard, because we’re up against other smart and innovative companies that are determined to win.\"A House antitrust subcommittee was set to grill Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai and Zuckerberg on Monday, but the hearing was delayed due to a memorial service for the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.  Zuckerberg admitted that the size of the tech industry should create cause for concern and said companies such as his should not be singlehandedly making major decisions about national policy.  \"I understand that people have concerns about the size and perceived power that tech companies have,\" he continued. \"Ultimately, I believe companies shouldn’t be making so many judgments about important issues like harmful content, privacy and election integrity on their own. That’s why I’ve called for a more active role for governments and regulators and updated rules for the Internet. If we do this right, we can preserve what’s best about this technology — the freedom for people to connect and express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things — while also protecting society from broader harms.\"  COLORADO REP. KEN BUCK SAYS BIG TECH CEO HEARING WILL COVER PRIVACY, ANTITRUST AND BIAS ALLEGATIONS VideoThe tech industry leader then discusses censorship and the removal of certain content from online platforms, if they qualify as \"harmful.\"  \"We’ve built sophisticated systems to find and remove harmful content,\" he explained. \"We’re funding new technologies to tackle emerging threats like deep fakes. And we’re building products to connect people to authoritative information, like our recently introduced COVID-19 and voter information centers.\"Zuckerberg championed Facebook for connecting citizens to coronavirus statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), while also purging any data or stories considered to be \"misinformation,\" with regard to COVID-19.  He also announced a new Facebook coronavirus \"symptom survey,\" which would take personal health data that is shared by users and combine it with location information, to discover \"where it's appropriate to roll back social distancing orders.\"    \"We connect people to authoritative health information and we’re taking aggressive steps to stop COVID-19-related misinformation and harmful content from spreading,\" he wrote. \"In January, we started displaying educational pop-ups in Facebook and Instagram connecting people to authoritative COVID-19-related information from organizations including the CDC, regional health authorities, and the WHO.\"We’re also using data in new ways to inform the public health response,\" Zuckerberg continued. \"We partnered with Carnegie Mellon University to launch a COVID-19 Symptom Survey that can help researchers predict the spread of the disease. With millions of responses, researchers are able to get a much more detailed picture of the pandemic. We also contributed aggregated anonymized location data to the COVID-19 Mobility Data Network, a group of 40 health researchers whose work helps governments determine if and where it’s appropriate to roll back social distancing orders.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    Facebook has a responsibility to stop people from interfering with online COVID conversations and is tasked with helping to eliminate voter suppression and hate speech, he claimed.\"I understand the concerns people have in these areas, and we are working to address them,\" he said. \"While we are making progress – for example, we have dramatically improved our ability to proactively find and remove harmful content and prevent election interference – I recognize that we have more to do.\"Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., told Fox News about the agenda for the hearing and said, \"There are three issues we are going to be looking at in this hearing. One is the anticompetitive behavior of these platforms. The second is the privacy issue and the third is the bias that some of these platforms engage in.\"                                          \n",

DO THIS INSTEAD  There’s so much built into our smartphones. I’ve been on Team iPhone since the first model, and I’m still discovering new things. No matter your model, I bet there are hidden features you’ll be happy to know.  Find a little peace: White noise is great for getting things done, falling asleep or drowning out more annoying sounds. You don’t need an extra app. Open Settings and tap Accessibility > Audio/Visual > Background Sounds. On the next screen, enable \"Background Sounds\" and tap Sound. Choose between Ocean, Rain, Stream and more.   An Apple iPhone 15 Pro is seen in this illustration photo taken at the store in Krakow, Poland on Oct. 31, 2023. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)  No more clutter: You can take photos through the Notes app on your iPhone so they don’t appear in your camera roll. Go to Settings > Notes, then turn off \"Save to Photos.\" Now, open the Notes app. Create a new note and tap the camera icon > Take Photo or Video.Quick privacy checkup: The App Privacy Report shows how apps use your data. Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > App Privacy Report to access. You can revoke any permissions here if you see something you don’t like.  YOUR PHONE HAS AN EXPIRATION DATE. HERE’S HOW TO FIND IT.G’day mate: You can change your smart assistant’s voice if its dulcet tones get on your nerves. I like the Australian woman’s voice. On iPhone: Go to Settings > Siri & Search > Siri Voice. For Android: On most phones that use Google Assistant, say, \"Hey Google, open Assistant settings.\" Go to All settings > Assistant voice and choose one.  For teeny-tiny print: Open Settings > Accessibility > Touch, then activate the Magnifier. Triple-click the side button, and voila! Your camera becomes a magnifying glass.

We all know that Google is a powerful search engine. It also tracks our online activities, locations and interests. The tech giant collects and stores a lot of data about us, which can be useful for some purposes yet also risky for others.    CLICK HERE TO GET MY FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTER WITH SECURITY ALERTS AND THE LATEST BLACK FRIDAY DEALS  Google collects and stores a lot of data about us, which can be useful for some purposes yet also risky for others. (Kurt Knutsson, CyberGuy)The double-edged sword of Google’s data in criminal investigationsOne of the purposes that Google’s data can serve is to help law enforcement solve crimes. Sometimes, when the police have few clues or leads, they can turn to Google for information on who searched for a certain term or who was near a crime scene at a certain time.  This also means that Google’s data can inadvertently implicate innocent people who happen to search for something or be somewhere that is related to a crime. They can become suspects or witnesses in investigations that they have nothing to do with.  Google’s data can help law enforcement solve crimes. (Kurt Knutsson, CyberGuy)How Google’s data is used in police investigations  There are two main ways that Google’s data is used in police investigations: search-term warrants and location warrants.  Google’s data is used in police investigations in two ways: search-term warrants and location warrants. (Kurt Knutsson, CyberGuy)  HOW TO DIG UP DIRT ABOUT YOURSELF ONLINESearch-term warrantsA search-term warrant is a court order that requires Google to provide information on anyone who searches for a specific term or phrase on its platform. Google does not provide the names or personal information of the users who searched for the terms, but rather anonymized identifiers that can be linked to specific devices. However, this does not mean that the users are completely anonymous, as the police can use other methods to track them down, such as IP addresses, geolocation or subpoenas.  For example, in 2020, Denver police obtained a search-term warrant for anyone who looked up the address of a house where a suspected arson killed five people. They used this information to identify and charge suspects with murder. However, those suspects were not convicted. Their lawyers argued that the warrants violated their constitutional rights.Search-term warrants are relatively rare, and their legality is still being debated in courts. Some judges have approved them, while others have rejected them as unconstitutional.  The main argument against them is that they violate the First Amendment right to free speech and the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  The main argument against search-term warrants is that they violate the First and the Fourth Amendments. (Kurt Knutsson, CyberGuy)    DON'T FALL FOR THIS LATEST ANTIVIRUS PROTECTION SCAMLocation warrantsA location warrant is a court order that requires Google to provide information on anyone who was near a certain location at a certain time based on the location data that Google collects from its users’ devices. These warrants can turn anyone into a suspect just by virtue of their GPS coordinates.For example, in Florida, police obtained a location warrant for anyone who was near the site of a home burglary and used this information to investigate a man who rode his bicycle nearby. The debate here centers on the balance between collective security and individual privacy.    Location warrants are more common than search-term warrants, and they have been used in various cases, including the 2021 Capitol riot. However, they also face legal challenges and criticism from civil liberties advocates.The main argument against them is that they are too broad and indiscriminate and that they sweep up innocent people who have no connection to the crime.  The use of large-scale warrants for Google data has both advantages and disadvantages for law enforcement and the public. (Kurt Knutsson, CyberGuy)HOW TO REIN IN YOUR ONLINE EXPOSURE  AND REMOVE YOURSELF FROM GOOGLE SEARCHESThe pros and cons of large-scale warrants for Google data  The use of large-scale warrants for Google data has both advantages and disadvantages for law enforcement and the public.    On one hand, these warrants can help solve crimes that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to crack. They can provide valuable leads and evidence that can link suspects to crimes or clear them from suspicion. They can also help identify victims or witnesses who may need protection or assistance.On the other hand, innocent people can get caught up in investigations that they have nothing to do with. Their privacy can be invaded, their personal information exposed, and intimidated and harassed.How Google balances user privacy and law enforcement requests  According to Google’s privacy policy, they have procedures to protect the privacy of their users while supporting the important work of law enforcement. They state that they carefully review each request for user information and try to limit the scope or object to it if it is too broad or does not follow the correct process. They also say that they notify users of requests for their information unless they are legally prohibited, or there is an imminent threat to life or serious physical injury.However, they also reserve the right to share user information with law enforcement in certain circumstances, such as when they have a valid legal process, a court order, a search warrant or an emergency disclosure request.  We reached out to Google for a comment on this story and had not heard back as of our deadline.   According to Google’s privacy policy, they have procedures to protect the privacy of their users while supporting the important work of law enforcement. (Kurt Knutsson, CyberGuy)  ASK KURT: HOW TO NAVIGATE GOOGLE'S PRIVACY SETTINGSWhat you can do to protect your privacy and rightsIf you are concerned about how Google’s data can be used in police investigations, there are some steps you can take to protect your privacy and rights.  One step is to limit the amount of data that Google collects and stores about you. You can do this by adjusting your privacy settings on your Google account, using private browsers, turning off your location services or using VPNs, deleting your search history or using incognito mode, and opting out of personalized ads, or using ad blockers. Even then, there is no guarantee your location and personal information isn’t being recorded.     Another step is to know your rights if you are contacted by law enforcement officials who want to access your Google data. You can do this by consulting a lawyer before you respond to any requests or demands.Ask for a copy of the warrant or court order that authorizes the access. You can challenge the validity or scope of the warrant or court order if it is too broad or vague. Seek legal representation if you are accused of a crime or sued for damages.Google’s data can be a powerful tool for solving crimes, but it can also be a potential threat to your privacy and rights. By being aware of how it is used in police investigations and by taking steps to protect yourself, you can enjoy the benefits of Google’s services without risking the drawbacks.  11 THINGS TO ADD TO YOUR PRIVACY CHECKLIST ONLINE ASAPKurt’s key takeaways  Google’s data can be both a blessing and a curse in a police investigation. It can help solve crimes, but it can also get you in trouble. That’s why it’s important to be careful about what you search and where you go online and to know your rights if the police come knocking.How do you feel about Google’s data collection and use in criminal investigations?

Review of the 2023 Best Antivirus Protection here.  Practice good cyber hygiene: Exercise caution in your digital interactions. Refrain from clicking on unsolicited links, particularly those associated with alarming notifications or ads urging you to download enticing media files.    Beware of suspicious ads: Specifically, for this NodeStealer campaign, you should be wary of any ad prompting the download of photo albums, especially if the source is Bitbucket, Gitlab, or Dropbox. Such ads are likely traps set by cybercriminals to deploy NodeStealer malware onto your device.Scrutinize unusual account activity: Keep an eye out for any unusual activity on your accounts. Unexpected password-reset emails, unrecognized logins, or uninitiated security changes can be red flags signaling a compromised account.Educate and inform: Share your knowledge about these threats with friends and family.

      "Facebook has come under intense scrutiny in the wake of revelations that election data company Cambridge Analytica accessed the private Facebook data of 50 million users. The social media giant is facing questions from U.S. and British regulators, and withering criticism in the press.  But the scandal is grounded in everyday America — after all, it was the millions of women, men, parents, grandparents, friends and old acquaintances on the site who had their data accessed.  \n",

      "NPR reached out to those everyday Americans. We asked how the unfolding controversy is affecting their views on digital privacy, and what (if any) impact it might have on their relationship with Facebook. What we found is a nation still deeply tied to the social network, but increasingly skeptical of its data privacy promises.  Still engaged A vast majority of the respondents said they still use Facebook or have used the site in the past. Only a small handful have left the site after creating an account, but almost all of those deserters said privacy concerns contributed to their decision to deactivate their accounts. Charlotte McGinn of Los Angeles said that \"after reading all of the news about Facebook's lack of concern for their users' data,\" she left the site for a second time, convinced that there were \"more than enough reasons to quit again.\" Despite these widespread concerns, most users are sticking with Facebook. And even outside of the site, they are using apps which access their Facebook data.  \n",

      "Less than half of respondents said they knew what apps could view their profile and activity on the social media site. Of those who checked, many reported that dozens of apps had access. For some, that number was even higher — at over 100 apps with some level of access to their Facebook data.  But users still try to limit what apps they allow in. Chicago's Reuben George says he will \"only allow apps that I trust and use.\" And Sarah Friesen from St. Louis said she tries to \"periodically review which apps are authorized and remove them if rarely used.\" \n",

      "\n",
      "Facebook's \"hard and confusing\" policies And while there are no signs yet of mass departures, the site's growth has been flat inside of the United States for the past two years. At this point, just about every American who wants a Facebook profile already has one. For Facebook, that means the only direction its U.S. user base can go is down. And as we noted above, nearly every respondent to our questionnaire who left Facebook said they did so because of data privacy concerns. But leaving the site is an extreme measure, and most users who responded said they try to find a balance between Facebook's convenience and its reliance on their personal data. Almost all respondents indicated that they take some measures to limit what others can see about them.  \n",

      "Many try to control their online audience. \"I limit what I post and make public,\" Carl Pittman told NPR. \"My posts are directed at my friends.\" Others avoid apps, websites and programs that request their data or seem suspicious. And one respondent even said she uses a private security company to lock down her personal data.  But respondents said they were unsure what options and settings they had available to protect their private information. Jennifer Socarras, from Georgia, said she tried to block Facebook's data collection but its policies were \"hard and confusing.\" Steven Begy of Rochester, N.Y., said he used the tools provided by Facebook, but added: \"I haven't done so in about 5 years, and who knows what has changed in that time.\" \"Tip of an iceberg?\" For many users, their concerns extend beyond the threat of identity theft or having their boss see an embarrassing photo. As the Cambridge Analytica episode illustrates, the data found on Facebook can be used in ways never predicted — or consented to — by its users.  \n",

      "Kristine Hester, a public school teacher near Chicago, says she needs to maintain a professional presence online. But she said she's \"increasingly concerned\" about the ways big data can be utilized, fearing that the information can be \"used to, essentially, create psychological weapons of culture war.\"  And this sentiment — that the current episode is a reflection of a broader technological shift — is common. \"Is this just an issue with Cambridge Analytica, or the tip of an iceberg?\" one respondent asked.  For Hester, it raises tough questions for the social media site. \"How does Facebook square its 'values' of promoting human connection with the unbelievable ease with which society utilized it (and other platforms) to sow discord and division?\" she asked.  \n",

      "The recent revelations that personal data from about 50 million Facebook users were used by a data analytics firm working for the Trump campaign are making a lot of the social network's users uneasy. Some are wondering if there's a better way to limit who can access their personal information. Shanna Carlile-Roy, a part time student living in a remote area of northern California, is on Facebook, but she's uncomfortable with its privacy policies. Yet she stays on the site. \"I feel trapped with the site because it's such a form of connection that I've become dependent on,\" she says. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Carlile-Roy tries to use Facebook's privacy settings. But she says it's not so easy. \"You're expected to go and try to research it yourself, read through all the fine print and it's still really elusive,\" she says. \n",

      "There are a few things you can do. Let's start with apps. Cambridge Analytica, the firm with ties to the Trump campaign, got user data through a researcher who had an app. Apps are one way your Facebook information winds up outside of its walls. When you use an app for a game, a survey or anything, you're sharing your data. There is a way to stop this. Emory Roane of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse says \"users can and certainly should go to their Facebook page and check their connected apps.\" To do that, go to settings. Click on Apps. Click on Apps, Websites and Plugins. Then you can deny access to all apps by clicking \"disable platform.\" That's straightforward. If you don't want to deny all apps, you can deny access to certain details about yourself — your religion, your family connections, your interests. Just click on \"Edit\" for \"Apps Others Use.\" If you don't want Facebook following you around, Roane says, turn off location services. \"If it's asking for your location information all the time or when the app is up,\" he says, \"maybe set it to only when the app is up or disable it altogether.\" \n",

Still, Terrell McSweeny, a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, warns users not to be overly confident of keeping all their information private. There are certain details that will be made public on Facebook no matter what you do. \"Your name, your profile picture, your gender, your cover photos, your networks, your user name are always publicly available,\" McSweeny says. \"That's part of the policy of that website.\" \n",

You'd be spending your day full time dealing with Facebook.\" \n",

      "Chester does not think creating better privacy controls is the answer for consumers. \"I think for the average person there's nothing that one can do to protect their privacy,\" he says. Chester thinks Europe has the right idea. On May 25, a new law there will take effect allowing regulators there \"to be able to come down heavy on Facebook, Google and the others,\" Chester says. The companies will be required \"to get your permission first before they can use your data and create new limits on the ways that Facebook and Google and others operate,\" he adds. Chester says it will be interesting to see if the new rules in Europe hurt Facebook profits. In an interview earlier this week on CNN, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wouldn't object to some regulation of Facebook. But it seems unlikely he'd welcome what's about to happen in Europe. \n",

      "NOEL KING, HOST:  Lawmakers in Washington talk a lot about reining in technology companies, but they're not really doing anything. So state legislatures are trying. They've advanced dozens of bills, but making law means going up against Silicon Valley and its lobbyists. Here's NPR's Bobby Allyn.BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Connecticut Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff was frustrated. Congress couldn't pass a bill protecting Americans' data, and he wanted Connecticut residents to know how and when they were being tracked online because right now, he says, there's a data privacy crisis.BOB DUFF: And that is known to any American who has a phone, laptop or tablet or any type of device where all of a sudden they mention something, next thing you know, there's an ad for it.ALLYN: So he introduced a bill last year that would allow people in Connecticut to opt out of data collection and to sue tech companies if they did it anyway. During a hearing for the bill, Duff looked around the room. It was packed. But he didn't see concerned citizens. Instead, he saw seat after seat filled with lobbyists paid by Facebook and Google and other tech companies.DUFF: Lobbyists put the fear of God in the people, even by saying something like this bill would harm data collection during a public health emergency, which is far from the truth, and it's actually inaccurate.ALLYN: His bill ultimately failed. The industry's leading trade group, the Internet Association, told Duff in a letter that the bill is, quote, \"of significant concern. Having the right to sue,\" the group wrote, \"would be a payday for trial lawyers and not help consumers safeguard their data.\" Now Duff has reintroduced the bill but caved by removing the right to sue tech companies. But he says he won't be giving up anything more otherwise...DUFF: We'll only really be lipstick on a pig from a standpoint of it's an industry-written bill that has data privacy in the headline. But other than that, it does nothing.ALLYN: Silicon Valley is setting up shop at state capitols across the country. Records show the big five tech companies have at least 14 registered lobbyists in Connecticut alone. It's a phenomenon that has been ramping up in recent years as states from Arkansas to Florida push bills looking to hem in the power of big tech. In response, the tech industry is pouring millions of dollars to get into the game of state politics.ASHKAN SOLTANI: For two decades, industry would argue that self-regulation is sufficient and not to meddle with the golden goose that's the internet.ALLYN: Ashkan Soltani is a data privacy advocate and a former Federal Trade Commission official. Now he says Silicon Valley views some type of regulation as unavoidable. Companies like Facebook have even publicly welcomed it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: We support updated internet regulations to set new standards for data portability, privacy and elections. Learn more at...ALLYN: Soltani is skeptical.SOLTANI: They're not doing it out of the goodness of their heart. You know, kind of like a taekwondo move, they want to capture that momentum and then direct it into something that benefits them.ALLYN: Several lobbyists and spokespeople for the companies declined to be interviewed for this story. Cathy Gellis, a San Francisco-area lawyer who specializes in tech policy, says some of the big tech pushback to state proposals has a point.CATHY GELLIS: You don't want the internet to become a you-can't-get-there-from-here type of place. And with local regulation, that's what we risk.ALLYN: She says regulations aimed at one thing can create unintended consequences someplace else for things like online commerce, speech and innovation. If companies have to follow one set of data tracking laws in one state and a whole other set in another, that's a nightmare for everyone. But it might just be what happens if Congress doesn't pass comprehensive internet reforms.Bobby Allyn, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF MARLEY CARROLL'S \"SEVEN CROWS\")\n",

Passed by the Federal Communications Commission in October, the rules never went into effect. If they had, it would have given consumers more control over how ISPs use the data they collect.

      "These rules wouldn't have applied to the likes of Google or Facebook — massive data collectors and digital advertisers — and that has been a major point of contention for ISPs. But consumer groups argue that's no reason to roll back restrictions on Internet providers. Plus, they point out, you could abandon those companies in favor of other websites, if you disagree with their policies; switching Internet providers is not so easy. ISPs have long attempted to break into the ad-targeting and online marketing world, where the competition is intense. For context on what that market looks like, I turned to Jules Polonetsky, privacy expert and CEO of the Future of Privacy Forum, a nonprofit organization promoting responsible data collection. Below are excerpts of the interview, edited for clarity and length.  Interview Highlights On what's going on and what changes For the average consumer, just about every site they visit online is sharing data with other ad networks, with other third parties, for the purpose of either measuring or targeting ads. ... Even most privacy organizations end up using Google Analytics or some other basic tools. ... \n",

      " Use a virtual private network (VPN). Look for emails from your Internet service provider allowing you to opt out of ad-targeting programs. Turn on your browser's do-not-track feature. Clear or reset the ad ID on your smartphone. Turn off location-based ads on your iPhone. \n",

      "For better or worse, the predominant business model online has become ad-supported. ... So for the average user, the experience isn't likely to change one way or another — today they see ads targeted based on their activity; tomorrow they'll see ads based on their activity. Now, what choices people have maybe has gotten a little bit more complicated. ... ISPs have historically played a very small role in (the ad targeting) market for a range of reasons. The most interesting and valuable data is search, social media data — and that is typically only available to the big portals that have that data. The ISPs don't have it if it's encrypted. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "... The big challenge for big advertisers is that their audience is dispersed across laptop, and mobile, and tablet, and TV and elsewhere. And linking that user's identity is a challenge. ... And this is a place where ISPs are able to play a role. ... They now have something to offer — cross-device capabilities — that others can do, but others have to do it differently. ... On existing opt-out options The ad networks of the world offer an opt-out of ad targeting today. If there's a triangle \"i\" on your banner ad, that means that that company is tailoring ads based on your Web surfing and is offering you an opt-out. \n",

Apps don't support cookies, but the ad ID supplied by the operating system — Apple now lets you wipe that out, Google lets you reset it. So that's a pretty effective opt-out system for apps at least. Use of location, similarly. On ISPs' argument that Google, Facebook, et al. are collecting more data and yet have less stringent regulation For better or worse, online data has been democratized and there are third-party ad exchanges where anybody can show up and have access to a big swath of your Web surfing. \n",

      "The BlueKai Bluebook, which is provided to potential advertisers, has 80 sources of data where Oracle's BlueKai data exchange has linked together data from Web surfing, from offline purchases, from all sorts of providers who have pulled data about you that they have online. ... So I've kind of looked at some of this debate with a bit of bemusement because I see the activity in these third-party data markets and that horse is out of that barn. I think for consumers who a more privacy-protective experience, there are a number of options, none of them are perfect — other than, perhaps using a VPN, which may not be easy for everyone to use. ... \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news is that an increasing amount of the activity online is encrypted, due to lots of advocacy. ... Increasingly, much of what you do is shielded from third parties because of encryption in place. The ISPs typically — in their efforts to use this data even before this (FCC) rule — have been providing consumers with ISP-level opt-outs. ... People should look for emails — typically they do push out an announcement when they roll out an ad-targeting program. On the regulatory oversight of privacy The FTC has generally been the lead privacy enforcer, and I think has been very aggressive at doing so. If you look at the recent Vizio case, they were able to take very strong action against sharing of your viewing history. ... At the end of the day, the willingness of the FCC and the FTC to use their authority effectively is what will determine whether the consumers are protected. The FCC (has in the past) used even its high-level authority very aggressively, and the FTC certainly historically has. We obviously don't know exactly how the new chairs will. ... On how ISPs' data collection compares to that of Google, Facebook and others The ad networks of the world typically share, swap and trade data via various exchanges. Google and Facebook have policies that to some degree use your data for ad targeting, but may limit the further use of it. For instance, Facebook does not want your Facebook data being shared — they'd like advertisers to come to Facebook to (place) ads on Facebook. \n",

      "That may be a nuance because ... to a consumer, data being used to tailor their experience is probably what makes a difference — whether it's being sold or used in a way that tracks and targets them. So the implementations that we see in the market of ISPs have focused on allowing the ISP to help ad network partners to do a better job of recognizing users. ... I think at the end of the day, for consumers, it ends up being parsing hairs. So the question is ... do the sites I visit get information that allows ads to be targeted based on other information about me? And that information isn't just Web browsing — a big part of ad-targeting today involves pinging on offline data, my actual purchases at a supermarket, my actual transactions. ... \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So what the advertisers are often looking to do is to work with partners who are able to put them and their offers in front of the users they want to reach. Sometimes, that's \"here's the Web browsing history,\" which they can get from an exchange, or they can get by going on one of the big portals, or presumably they'll be able to get by going to ISPs. The market doesn't think about it in terms of selling data — the market thinks about it in terms of \"how does an advertiser find the audience that it thinks it wants.\" ... And different providers in the market will create those audiences. On what users can do to restrict or entirely limit their data from being collected It pays to opt out of the behavioral advertising, when you see that triangle \"i,\" because thousands of companies will at least not target you — they may still be collecting data, but they're not gonna be tailoring the ads that you see. \n",

Choosing encrypted tools when you use email or make decisions about what sites and services (to use) — far less information about what you do during the day is going to be available. For the changes that have been made today, those tools are going to be effective, because the uses that the ISPs are likely to be interested are, frankly, these tailoring and targeting uses — and so (these tools) for most people are going to be reasonable. They're not going to promise you absolute privacy, but neither would have the FCC rule. ... If you're really looking to disengage from the commercial world, it's hard to take advantage of much of the Web without being fairly technically savvy. ... If today's vote allows ISPs broader latitude with how they can use data, primarily for advertising and marketing uses, most of these tools will turn off those functions. And consumers should look for the options that the ISPs should offer in addition.\n",

      "It's becoming increasingly clear that the end of Roe will look vastly different than before Roe — in large part because of the role of data.  Since the Supreme Court ruled that abortion access wasn't a constitutional right, several states states have already enacted bans out of the two dozen states that are expected to ban or restrict the procedure. The court ruling has prompted a wave of women to delete their menstrual cycle apps out of worry about potentially incriminating themselves in the future. On social media, some have encouraged using coded language when posting about abortion access as a way to avert law enforcement's attention. And in Congress, some Democratic lawmakers are working on plans to better protect people's personal data as it relates to reproductive health.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Although there's still a lot that's still unknown about how or what kinds of data will be used as evidence, digital privacy advocates are encouraging both abortion seekers and supporters to err on the side of caution.  \"The depth of information about us that the police can try to access in investigations is unprecedented in human history,\" said Nathan Wessler, the deputy project director of the Speech, Privacy and Technology Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.  \n",

      "\"We are likely to see in states that are banning abortion, really invasive investigations into people who are seeking medical care,\" he added. Data may be used against anyone seeking reproductive care It's not just call histories, text messages and emails that may be used to prosecute, but also location data, online payment records, Google searches and fertility tracking apps, data experts predict.  That list may only begin to scratch the surface because when it comes to personal data, it's still unclear how much we produce and who can see it.  \"We live in a digital age when our activities, our movements, our transactions and our communications leave a digital trail,\" Wessler said. \"And it is extraordinarily hard to eliminate all of the digital trails that might be of interest to law enforcement.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He also worries that a wide spectrum of people seeking reproductive care will be subject to invasive, digital investigations by the police.  \"A woman who shows up in an emergency room after a miscarriage may suddenly be subject to police digging through her every digital communication record to figure out whether it's a miscarriage or not,\" he added. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital privacy advocate, says that period tracking apps don't pose the most immediate danger for women seeking abortions in states where they are banned. Rather, the group mentions text messages, browser histories and emails as being more commonly used in criminal investigations. The group recommends using encryption and being aware of your phone's privacy settings. Personal data may be in the hands of bounty hunters  In some states, it won't just be law enforcement who can get their hands on people's personal data.  So far, Texas, Oklahoma and Idaho have passed citizen-enforced abortion bans, meaning anyone can file a civil lawsuit if they believe an abortion was performed and possibly win at least $10,000. \n",

      "This bounty system will also allow plaintiffs to request troves of data in order to build their case, according to Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at EFF. Although there's still a lot to understand about who may be sued or what kinds of digital investigations may take place, Galperin adds that there's a risk in the uncertainty.  \"It's terrifying,\" said Galperin. \"Suddenly, if you're doing abortion support, it's much harder to know who to trust.\" Pregnant people of color may be under great digital surveillance  What's left some privacy experts on edge is how much is unknown about how the growing number of state laws that criminalize abortions will be enforced. \"They are often broad and vaguely written, and this was their purpose,\" said Galperin. \"And the reason for that is because they want people who are seeking abortions and providing abortion support to assume the worst and therefore, not act.\" \n",

      "Galperin believes the threat of digital surveillance won't stop people from seeking or supporting such procedures but it will pose great risk for those seeking care and disproportionately impact pregnant women of color.  \"People of color have always been the guinea pigs for surveillance and for cracking down on any kind of unwanted behavior in the United States,\" Galperin said.  Wessler adds that the degree of tech savviness, time and effort required to avoid leaving a digital footprint might not be achievable to some, which is why he believes the federal government needs to do a better job in protecting pregnant people in crisis.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If our data is out there free for the taking without protections against corporate misuse and government misuse, we're in a bad place,\" he says. \"That's why we really need better legal structures to protect us.\"\n",

      "Viewed out of context, recent Washington revelations paint a disturbing portrait of the vast amount of electronic data the nation's spy agencies are collecting. But the blockbuster news stories belie a simple truth: Personal privacy rights have been under sustained assault since well before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. And it's not just government that's vacuuming up information. Dating to the early 1990s, growth in electronic commerce has been facilitated and driven by advances in data collection and storage. What we read, where we live, what we buy, whom we call, what music we listen to, what movies we watch in our homes, the names of childhood pets and mothers' maiden names — all of it, and much more, now lives on a server farm somewhere For the most part, Americans haven't loudly objected to this slow erosion of privacy: Much of our personal information has been surrendered willingly as a result of our eagerness to connect through social media and our ravenous consumption habits. What many consumers don't know, however, is how aggressively Big Tech has moved to track and combine the data to build user profiles. As for the growth of the national security state and its snooping habits, even as its tentacles have expanded there have been few signs of political backlash. \n",

      "Here are some notable milestones over the past two decades that help explain how we got to this point: 1994: The birth of the cookie Netscape is credited with inventing the browser \"cookie,\" the innocently named little computer file that enables firms to build a profile of a user by recognizing and tracking his or her Web surfing behavior. 1995: The European Union sounds an alarm Against the backdrop of long-standing, pre-Internet concerns about privacy and the protection of personal data, the EU issues its first data protection directive regarding the processing of personal data and its free movement. 1997: What privacy policy? The Electronic Privacy Information Center reviews 100 of the most frequently visited Internet sites and reports in June 1997 that only 17 have explicit privacy policies. None meet basic standards for privacy protection, according to the public interest research center. \"We were not able to determine whether web sites are linking data collected on-line with other databases,\" wrote EPIC. \"This classic computer matching technique is oftentimes one of the first indicators of a privacy problem. It is also likely to emerge as a significant issue in the near future.\" 1999: Big Brother zeroes in  The first commercially available GPS phone is launched by mobile phone manufacturer Benefon and sold mainly in Europe. Even before such GPS-enabled mobile phones are widely available in the U.S., in August 2001 PCWorld magazine asks, \"Will Big Brother Track You by Cell Phone?\" \n",

      "2001: The Sept. 11 era begins Six weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush signs the Patriot Act into law. The bill, which grants broad new surveillance powers to law enforcement and intelligence agencies, is designed \"to identify, to dismantle, to disrupt and to punish terrorists before they strike.\" After passing both the House and Senate by wide margins, the Patriot Act widens the scope of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, and includes a variety of provisions that allow for expanded data collection and surveillance by government, as well as disclosure of electronic communications. \n",

Aside from concerns over its scope, the Orwellian ring to the program's name proves problematic. Within months of the initial headlines revealing its existence, it's changed to a less threatening moniker: \"Terrorism Information Awareness.\" 2005: Warrantless surveillance The New York Times reports in December 2005: \"Months after the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans and others inside the United States to search for evidence of terrorist activity without the court-approved warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying, according to government officials. \"Under a presidential order signed in 2002, the intelligence agency has monitored the international telephone calls and international e-mail messages of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people inside the United States without warrants over the past three years in an effort to track possible 'dirty numbers' linked to Al Qaeda, the officials said. The agency, they said, still seeks warrants to monitor entirely domestic communications.\" \n",

      "2006: Facebook launches News Feed In September 2006, Facebook, the popular social networking service, launches its new News Feed feature, which broadcasts changes members make to their Web profiles to the pages of others in their Facebook social networks. After an uproar, fueled by complaints about the invasiveness of the feature, Facebook quickly apologizes and lets users disable or modify it. A year later, Facebook again angers users with the introduction of Beacon, a program that sends news alerts to users' friends about which goods and services they purchased online. After widespread criticism and a class-action lawsuit, Beacon is shut down in late 2009. \n",

      "2007: Google launches Street View A new feature of Google Maps, Street View enables users to view and navigate within 360-degree panoramic street-level imagery of various U.S. cities. \"With Street View users can virtually walk the streets of a city, check out a restaurant before arriving, and even zoom in on bus stops and street signs to make travel plans,\" says Google in a May 29 announcement. The remarkably detailed imagery immediately sparks a privacy debate, but it takes a back seat to a later revelation that Google's Street View cars — the ones taking the photos — had also collected sensitive personal information from wireless home networks. The company tells Federal Trade Commission investigators that it had mistakenly collected the data. \"We are mortified by what happened, but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users,\" the company explains. Google outlines the problem and the plans to fix it in a blog post. 2008: FISA amended Congress passes the FISA Amendments Act in July 2008, expanding the federal government's surveillance powers and giving immunity to telecom companies that assist in a warrantless surveillance program. 2009: Facebook changes the rules Tens of thousands of Facebook users protest against terms of service changes that allow Facebook to use anything uploaded to the site at any time, even after users have deleted their profiles and left Facebook. After the backlash, the company reverts to its original policy and issues a statement of rights and responsibilities surrounding its relationship with users. 2011: Bad Buzz Google agrees to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it used deceptive tactics and violated its own privacy promises to consumers when it launched its social network Google Buzz in 2010. Google had received thousands of complaints from users who were concerned about public disclosure of their email contacts which included, in some cases, ex-spouses, patients, students, employers or competitors. \n",

In a blog post, the company explains the plan will lead to \"a beautifully simple, intuitive user experience across Google.\" \"Our new Privacy Policy makes clear that, if you're signed in, we may combine information you've provided from one service with information from other services,\" Google writes. \"In short, we'll treat you as a single user across all our products, which will mean a simpler, more intuitive Google experience.\" 2012: FTC vs. Google, again Google agrees to pay a $22.5 million fine to settle allegations that it violated terms of the settlement order it signed in 2011 surrounding Buzz. The Federal Trade Commission levied the penalty on Google — the largest ever imposed for violating a commission order — for misleading millions of users of Apple's Safari Web browser about tracking their online activities.
